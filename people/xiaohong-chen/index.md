## Quotes

- *What can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence.* --- Ludwig Wittgenstein.
- *Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.* --- John von Neumann.
- What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease. --- Sun Tzu, The Art of War.
- *Thus, if you do not accumulate little steps, you will not have the means to journey a thousand li, and if you do not pile up small streams, you will have no way to fill a river or a sea.* --- Xunzi, Encouraging Learning.
