Welcome to the Formal Systems Laboratory (FSL) of the [Department of Computer
Science] at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] (UIUC). FSL was
founded in 2002 by Grigore Rosu, when he joined UIUC (from NASA Ames). In the
FSL, we design and develop:

-   foundational and theoretical models,
-   specification and programming languages, techniques and methodologies,
    as well as
-   software analysis prototypes and tools,

all aiming at increasing the quality of computing systems.
