Welcome to the **Formal Systems Laboratory (FSL)** of the [Department of Computer
Science] at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] (UIUC). FSL was
founded in 2002 by [Grigore Rosu](/fsl//people/grigore-rosu/index.html), when he joined UIUC 
(from [NASA Ames](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html)). 
In the FSL, we design and develop:

-   foundational and theoretical models,
-   specification and programming languages, techniques and methodologies,
    as well as
-   software analysis prototypes and tools,

all aiming at increasing the quality of computing systems.
