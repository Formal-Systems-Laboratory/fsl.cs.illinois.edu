  abstract: We give an overview on the applications and foundations of the K language
    framework, a semantic framework for programming languages and formal analysis
    tools. K represents a 20-year effort in pursuing the ideal language framework
    vision, where programming languages must have formal definitions, and tools for
    a given language, such as parsers, interpreters, compilers, semantic-based debuggers,
    state-space explorers, model checkers, deductive program verifiers, etc., can
    be derived from just one reference formal definition of the language, which is
    executable, and no other semantics for the same language should be needed. The
    correctness of the languages tools is guaranteed on a case-by-case basis by proof
    objects, which encode rigorous mathematical proofs as certificates for every individual
    tasks that the tools do and can be mechanically checked by third-party proof checkers.
