  abstract  = {
    Early efforts in runtime verification show
      that parametric regular and temporal logic specifications
      can be monitored efficiently.  These approaches, however,
    have limited expressiveness: their specifications always
      reduce to monitors with finite state.
      More recent developments
      showed that parametric context-free properties can be efficiently
      monitored with overheads generally lower than 12-15%.
      While context-free grammars are more expressive than finite-state
      languages, they still do not allow every computable safety property.
      This paper presents a monitor synthesis algorithm for string rewriting
      systems (SRS).
      SRSs are well known to be Turing complete, allowing
      for the formal specification of any computable safety property.  
        Earlier attempts at Turing complete monitoring have been relatively 
          inefficient.  This paper demonstrates that monitoring parametric
          SRSs is practical.  The presented algorithm uses
          a modified version of Aho-Corasick string searching 
          for quick pattern matching with an incremental rewriting approach
            that avoids reexamining parts of the string known to contain no
              redexes.
