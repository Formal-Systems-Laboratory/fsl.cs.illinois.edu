  abstract: Automation of fixpoint reasoning has been extensively studied for various
    mathematical structures, logical formalisms, and computational domains, resulting
    in specialized fixpoint provers for heaps, for streams, for term algebras, for
    temporal properties, for program correctness, and for many other formal systems
    and inductive and coinductive properties. However, in spite of great theoretical
    and practical interest, there is no unified framework for automated fixpoint reasoning.
    Although several attempts have been made, there is no evidence that such a unified
    framework is possible, or practical. In this paper, we propose a candidate based
    on matching logic, a formalism recently shown to theoretically unify the above
    mentioned formal systems. Unfortunately, the (Knaster-Tarski) proof rule of matching
    logic, which enables inductive reasoning, is not syntax-driven. Worse, it can
    be applied at any step during a proof, making automation seem hopeless. Inspired
    by recent advances in automation of inductive proofs in separation logic, we propose
    an alternative proof system for matching logic, which is amenable for automation.
    We then discuss our implementation of it, which although not superior to specialized
    state-of-the-art automated provers for specific domains, we believe brings some
    evidence and hope that a unified framework for automated reasoning is not out
    of reach.
