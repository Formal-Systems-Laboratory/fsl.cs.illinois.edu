  abstract: 'A developing field of interest for the distributed systems and applied
    cryptography communities is that of smart contracts: self-executing financial
    instruments that synchronize their state, often through a blockchain. One such
    smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum,
    which has grown to a market capacity of 100 billion USD and clears an excess of
    500,000 daily transactions. Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has
    been marred by a series of costly bugs and exploits. Increasingly, the Ethereum
    community has turned to formal methods and rigorous program analysis tools. This
    trend holds great promise due to the relative simplicity of smart contracts and
    bounded-time deterministic execution inherent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine
    (EVM). Here we present KEVM, an executable formal specification of the EVM''s
    bytecode stack-based language built with the \K{} Framework, designed to serve
    as a solid foundation for further formal analyses. We empirically evaluate the
    correctness and performance of KEVM using the official Ethereum test suite~\cite{ethereum-tests-url}.
    To demonstrate the usability, several extensions of the semantics are presented
    and two different-language implementations of the ERC20 Standard Token are verified
    against the ERC20 specification. These results are encouraging for the executable
    semantics approach to language prototyping and specification.'
