abstract: This paper gives a truly concurrent semantics with sharing of resources
  for the K semantic framework, an executable (term-)rewriting-based formalism for
  defining programming languages and calculi. Akin to graph rewriting rules, the K
  (rewrite) rules explicitly state what can be concurrently shared with other rules.
  The desired true concurrency is obtained by translating the K rules into a novel
  instance of term-graph rewriting with explicit sharing, and then using classical
  concurrency from the double-pushout (DPO) approach to graph rewriting. The resulting
  parallel term-rewriting relation is proved sound, complete, and serializable with
  respect to the jungle rewriting flavor of term-graph rewriting, and, therefore,
  also to term rewriting.
