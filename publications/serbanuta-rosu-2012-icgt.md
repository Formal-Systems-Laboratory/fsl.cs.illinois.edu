  abstract: This paper gives a truly concurrent semantics with sharing of resources
    for the K semantic framework, an executable (term-)rewriting-based formalism for
    defining programming languages and calculi. Akin to graph rewriting rules, the
    K (rewrite) rules explicitly state what can be concurrently shared with other
    rules. The desired true concurrency is obtained by translating the K rules into
    a novel instance of term-graph rewriting with explicit sharing, and then using
    classical concurrency from the double-pushout (DPO) approach to graph rewriting.
    The resulting parallel term-rewriting relation is proved sound, complete, and
    serializable with respect to the jungle rewriting flavor of term-graph rewriting,
    and, therefore, also to term rewriting.
