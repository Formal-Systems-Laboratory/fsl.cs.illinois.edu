  abstract: This paper studies the composition of modules that can hide information,
    over a very general class of logical systems called inclusive institutions. Two
    semantics are given for composition of such modules using five familiar operations,
    and a property called conservativity is shown necessary and sufficient for these
    semantics to agree. The first semantics extracts the visible properties of the
    result of composing the visible and hidden parts of modules, while the second
    uses only the visible properties of the components; the semantics agree when the
    visible consequences of hidden information are enough to determine the result
    of the composition. A number of laws of software composition are proved relating
    the composition operations. Inclusive institutions simplify many proofs.
