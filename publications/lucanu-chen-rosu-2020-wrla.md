  abstract: Constrained constructor patterns are built from pairs of constructor term
    patterns and a constraint expressed by a quantifier-free first order logic formula,
    using the conjunction and disjunction connector. They are used to express state
    predicates for reachability logic defined over rewrite theories. Matching logic
    has been recently proposed as a unifying foundation for programming languages,
    specification and verification. It has been shown to capture several logics important
    for programming languages, including First-order logic with Fixpoints and order-sorted
    algebra. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the language of
    the constrained constructor patterns and matching logic. The results we obtained
    from this comparison bring a mutual benefit for the two approaches. The matching
    logic can borrow computationally effcient proofs for some equivalences, and the
    language of the constrained constructor patterns can get a more logical avor and
    more expressivity.
