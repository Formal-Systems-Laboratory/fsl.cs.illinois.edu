abstract: Constrained constructor patterns are built from pairs of constructor term
  patterns and a constraint expressed by a quantifier-free first order logic formula,
  using the conjunction and disjunction connector. They are used to express state
  predicates for reachability logic defined over rewrite theories. Matching logic
  has been recently proposed as a unifying foundation for programming languages, specification
  and verification. It has been shown to capture several logics important for programming
  languages, including First-order logic with Fixpoints and order-sorted algebra.
  In this paper we investigate the relationship between the language of the constrained
  constructor patterns and matching logic. The results we obtained from this comparison
  bring a mutual benefit for the two approaches. The matching logic can borrow computationally
  effcient proofs for some equivalences, and the language of the constrained constructor
  patterns can get a more logical avor and more expressivity.
