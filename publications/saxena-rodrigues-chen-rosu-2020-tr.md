  abstract: Hybrid Automata (HA) form the backbone of modeling systems with both discrete
    and continuous components. However, the semantics of HA are usually described
    loosely using Labeled Transition Systems (LTS), and reasoning about HA involves
    informal proofs over LTS. In this paper, we propose a formally rigorous, concise,
    and semantically correct definition of HA in Matching Logic (ML), which is a uniform
    logic for programming languages design and verification. We show how our definition
    allows formal reasoning about HA using ML's proof system. Our approach exposes
    HA to a rich set of tools that operate over ML and provide a sound logical basis
    for various techniques like Deductive Verification, Monitoring and Runtime Verification.
