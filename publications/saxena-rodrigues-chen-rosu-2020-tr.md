abstract: Hybrid Automata (HA) form the backbone of modeling systems with both discrete
  and continuous components. However, the semantics of HA are usually described loosely
  using Labeled Transition Systems (LTS), and reasoning about HA involves informal
  proofs over LTS. In this paper, we propose a formally rigorous, concise, and semantically
  correct definition of HA in Matching Logic (ML), which is a uniform logic for programming
  languages design and verification. We show how our definition allows formal reasoning
  about HA using ML's proof system. Our approach exposes HA to a rich set of tools
  that operate over ML and provide a sound logical basis for various techniques like
  Deductive Verification, Monitoring and Runtime Verification.
