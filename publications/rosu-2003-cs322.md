    Language Design, taught by Grigore Rosu in the Fall 2003 semester at the University

    Of particular importance is the novel technique for defining concurrent languages
    that starts at page 673, based on a first-order representation of computations
    (called "continuations" for simplicity there, though only their suffix is an actual
    "continuation structure").'
