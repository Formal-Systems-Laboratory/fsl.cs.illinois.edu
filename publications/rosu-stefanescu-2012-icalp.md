  abstract: This paper presents a nine-rule *language-independent* proof system that
    takes an operational semantics as axioms and derives program reachability properties,
    including ones corresponding to Hoare triples. This eliminates the need for language-specific
    Hoare-style proof rules to verify programs, and, implicitly, the tedious step
    of proving such proof rules sound for each language separately. The key proof
    rule is *Circularity*, which is coinductive in nature and allows for reasoning
    about constructs with repetitive behaviors (e.g., loops). The generic proof system
    is shown sound and has been implemented in the MatchC verifier.
