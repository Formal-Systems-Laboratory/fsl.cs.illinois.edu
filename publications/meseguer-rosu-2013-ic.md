  abstract: 'Rewriting logic is an executable logical framework well suited for the
    semantic definition of languages. Any such framework has to be judged by its effectiveness
    to bridge the existing gap between language definitions on the one hand, and language
    implementations and language analysis tools on the other. We give a progress report
    on how researchers in the rewriting logic semantics project are narrowing the
    gap between theory and practice in areas such as: modular semantic definitions
    of languages; scalability to real languages; support for real time; semantics
    of software and hardware modeling languages; and semantics-based analysis tools
    such as static analyzers, model checkers, and program provers.'
