  abstract: 'This paper proposes the use of formal semantics as a basis for worst-case
    execution time (WCET) analysis. Specifically, the semantics of a RISC assembly
    language is formally defined using recent advances in rewrite-based semantics,
    and then is used to discover and eliminate erroneous execution paths in the context
    of WCET analysis. This paper makes two novel contributions: (1) it shows that
    using a formal semantics of the employed language can be practically feasible
    in WCET analysis (not only theoretically desirable); and (2) it shows that the
    discovery and elimination of erroneous execution paths can not only improve the
    WCET estimation, but can also be achieved using off-the-shelf technology for rewrite-based
    semantics.'
