  abstract: This paper introduces *reachability logic*, a language-independent seven-rule
    proof system for deriving reachability properties of systems. The key ingredients
    of *reachability logic* are its sentences, which are called *reachability rules*
    and generalize the transitions of operational semantics and the Hoare triples
    of axiomatic semantics, and the *Circularity* proof rule, which generalizes invariant
    proof rules for iterative and recursive constructs in axiomatic semantics. The
    target transition system is described as a set of reachability rules, which are
    taken as axioms in a reachability logic proof. Typical definition styles which
    can be read as collections of reachability rules include conventional small-step
    and big-step operational semantics. The reachability logic proof system is shown
    sound (in the sense of partial correctness) and relatively complete. The soundness
    result has also been formalized in Coq, allowing to convert reachability logic
    proofs into proof certificates depending only on the operational semantics and
    the unavoidable domain reasoning. Reachability logic thus eliminates the need
    to independently define an axiomatic and an operational semantics for each language,
    and the non-negligible effort to prove the former sound and complete w.r.t the
    latter.
