Proof-checking code for compliance to safety policies potentially enables a
product-oriented approach to certain aspects of software certification. To
date, previous research has focused on generic, low-level
programming-language properties such as memory type safety. In this paper
we consider proof-checking higher-level domain-specific properties for
compliance to safety policies.  The paper first describes a framework
related to abstract interpretation in which compliance to a class of
certification policies can be efficiently calculated. Membership equational
logic is shown to provide a rich logic for carrying out such calculations,
including partiality, for certification. The architecture for a
domain-specific certifier is described, followed by an implemented case
study. The case study considers consistency of abstract variable attributes
in code that performs geometric calculations in Aerospace systems.
