  abstract: 'Matching logic is a first-order logic (FOL) variant to reason about structure.
    Its sentences, called patterns, are constructed using variables, symbols, connectives
    and quantifiers, but no difference is made between function and predicate symbols.
    In models, a pattern evaluates into a power-set domain (the set of values that
    match it), in contrast to FOL where functions, predicates and connectives map
    into a domain. Matching logic generalizes several logical frameworks important
    for program analysis, such as: propositional logic, algebraic specification, FOL
    with equality, and separation logic. Patterns allow for specifying separation
    requirements at any level in any program configuration, not only in the heaps
    or stores, without any special logical constructs for that: the very nature of
    pattern matching is that if two structures are matched as part of a pattern, then
    they can only be spatially separated. Like FOL, matching logic can also be translated
    into pure predicate logic with equality, but it also admits its own sound and
    complete proof system.'
