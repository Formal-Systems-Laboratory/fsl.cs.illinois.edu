abstract: 'Matching logic is a first-order logic (FOL) variant to reason about structure.
  Its sentences, called patterns, are constructed using variables, symbols, connectives
  and quantifiers, but no difference is made between function and predicate symbols.
  In models, a pattern evaluates into a power-set domain (the set of values that match
  it), in contrast to FOL where functions, predicates and connectives map into a domain.
  Matching logic generalizes several logical frameworks important for program analysis,
  such as: propositional logic, algebraic specification, FOL with equality, and separation
  logic. Patterns allow for specifying separation requirements at any level in any
  program configuration, not only in the heaps or stores, without any special logical
  constructs for that: the very nature of pattern matching is that if two structures
  are matched as part of a pattern, then they can only be spatially separated. Like
  FOL, matching logic can also be translated into pure predicate logic with equality,
  but it also admits its own sound and complete proof system.'
