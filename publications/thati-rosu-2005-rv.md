  abstract: Program execution traces can be so large in practical testing and monitoring
    applications that it would be very expensive, if not impossible, to store them
    for detailed analysis. Monitoring execution traces {\em without storing} them,
    can be a nontrivial matter for many specification formalisms, because complex
    formulae may require a considerable amount of information about the past. {\em
    Metric temporal logic} (MTL) is an extension of propositional linear temporal
    logic with discrete-time-bounded temporal operators. In MTL, one can specify time
    limits within which certain temporal properties must hold, thus making it very
    suitable to express real-time monitoring requirements. In this paper, we present
    monitoring algorithms for checking timestamped execution traces against formulae
    in MTL or certain important sublogics of it. We also present lower bounds for
    the monitoring problem, showing that the presented algorithms are asymptotically
    optimal.
