  abstract: Matching logic was recently proposed as a unifying logic for specifying
    and reasoning about static structure and dynamic behavior of programs. In matching
    logic, patterns and specifications are used to uniformly represent mathematical
    domains (such as numbers and Boolean values), datatypes, and transition systems,
    whose properties can be reasoned about using one fixed matching logic proof system.
    In this paper we give a tutorial to matching logic. We use a suite of examples
    to explain the basic concepts of matching logic and show how to capture many important
    mathematical domains, datatypes, and transition systems using patterns and specifications.
    We put special emphasis on the general principles of induction and coinduction
    in matching logic and show how to do inductive and coinductive reasoning about
    datatypes and codatatypes. To encourage the development of the future tools for
    matching logic, we propose and use throughout the paper a human-readable formal
    syntax to write specifications in a modular and compact way.
