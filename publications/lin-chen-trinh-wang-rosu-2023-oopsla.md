  abstract: 'A language-agnostic program verifier takes three inputs: a program, its
    formal specification, and the formal semantics of the programming language in
    which the program is written. It then uses a language-agnostic verification algorithm
    to prove the program correct with respect to its specification, using directly
    the formal language semantics. Such a complex verifier can easily have bugs. This
    paper proposes a method to certify the correctness of each successful verification
    run by generating a proof certificate for it. The proof certificate can be checked
    by a small proof checker. The preliminary experiments apply the method to generate
    proof certificates for the verification of an imperative language, a functional
    language, and an assembly language, showing that the proposed method is language-agnostic.'
