  abstract: A coinduction-based technique to generate an optimal monitor from a Linear
    Temporal Logic (LTL) formula is presented in this paper. Such a monitor receives
    a sequence of states (one at a time) from a running process, checks them against
    a requirements specification expressed as an LTL formula, and determines whether
    the formula has been violated or validated. It can also say whether the LTL formula
    is not monitorable any longer, i.e., that the formula can in the future neither
    be violated nor be validated. A Web interface for the presented algorithm adapted
    to extended regular expressions is available.
