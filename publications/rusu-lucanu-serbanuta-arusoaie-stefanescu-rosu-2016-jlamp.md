  abstract: K is a formal framework for defining operational semantics of programming
    languages. The K-Maude compiler translates \K language definitions to Maude rewrite
    theories. The compiler enables program execution by using the Maude rewrite engine
    with the compiled definitions, and program analysis by using various Maude analysis
    tools. K supports symbolic execution in Maude by means of an automatic transformation
    of language definitions. The transformed definition is called the *\em symbolic
    extension* of the original definition. In this paper we investigate the theoretical
    relationship between K language definitions and their Maude translations, between
    symbolic extensions of K definitions and their Maude translations, and how the
    relationship between K definitions and their symbolic extensions is reflected
    on their respective representations in Maude. In particular, the results show
    how analysis performed with Maude tools can be formally lifted up to the original
    language definitions.
