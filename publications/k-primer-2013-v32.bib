  abstract  = {This paper serves as a brief introduction to the K tool, a system for formally defining programming languages.  It is shown how sequential or concurrent languages can be defined in K simply and modularly.  These formal definitions automatically yield an interpreter for the language, as well as program analysis tools such as a state-space explorer.},
