  abstract = {
We present the most complete and thoroughly tested formal semantics of x86-64
to date. Our semantics faithfully formalizes all the non-deprecated, sequential
user-level instructions of the x86-64 Haswell instruction set architecture.
This totals 3155 instruction variants, corresponding to 774 mnemonics. The
semantics is fully executable and has been tested against more than 7,000
instruction-level test cases and the GCC torture test suite. This extensive
testing paid off, revealing bugs in both the x86-64 reference manual and other
existing semantics. We also illustrate potential applications of our semantics
in different formal analyses, and discuss how it can be useful for processor
verification.
