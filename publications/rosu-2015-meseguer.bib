  abstract  = {
Rewriting logic has proven to be an excellent formalism to define executable
semantics of programming languages, concurrent or not, and then to derive
formal analysis tools for the defined languages with very little effort, such as
model checkers.
In this paper we give an overview of recent results obtained in the context of
the rewriting logic semantics framework K, such as complete semantics of
large programming languages like C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and deductive
program verification techniques that allow us to verify programs in these
languages using a common verification infrastructure.},
