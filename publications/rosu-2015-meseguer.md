abstract: Rewriting logic has proven to be an excellent formalism to define executable
  semantics of programming languages, concurrent or not, and then to derive formal
  analysis tools for the defined languages with very little effort, such as model
  checkers. In this paper we give an overview of recent results obtained in the context
  of the rewriting logic semantics framework K, such as complete semantics of large
  programming languages like C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and deductive program verification
  techniques that allow us to verify programs in these languages using a common verification
  infrastructure.
