  abstract: Rewriting logic has proven to be an excellent formalism to define executable
    semantics of programming languages, concurrent or not, and then to derive formal
    analysis tools for the defined languages with very little effort, such as model
    checkers. In this paper we give an overview of recent results obtained in the
    context of the rewriting logic semantics framework K, such as complete semantics
    of large programming languages like C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and deductive
    program verification techniques that allow us to verify programs in these languages
    using a common verification infrastructure.
