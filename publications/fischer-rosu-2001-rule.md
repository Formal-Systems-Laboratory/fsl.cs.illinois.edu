  abstract: We present a logical framework in which abstract interpretations can be
    naturally specified and then verified. Our approach is based on membership equational
    logic which extends equational logics by membership axioms, asserting that a term
    has a certain sort. We represent an abstract interpretation as a membership equational
    logic specification, usually as an overloaded order-sorted signature with membership
    axioms. It turns out that, for any term, its least sort over this specification
    corresponds to its most concrete abstract value. Maude implements membership equational
    logic and provides mechanisms to calculate the least sort of a term efficiently.
    We first show how Maude can be used to get prototyping of abstract interpretations
    for free. Building on the meta-logic facilities of Maude, we further develop a
    tool that automatically checks an abstract interpretation against a set of user-defined
    properties. This can be used to select an appropriate abstract interpretation,
    to characterize the specific loss of information during abstraction, and to compare
    different abstractions with each other.
