  abstract  = {
This paper introduces *reachability logic*, a language-independent proof system
for program verification, which takes an operational semantics as axioms and
derives *reachability rules*, which generalize Hoare triples.
This system improves on previous work by allowing operational semantics given
with *conditional* rewrite rules, which are known to support all major
styles of operational semantics.
In particular, Kahn's big-step and Plotkin's small-step semantic styles are
newly supported.
The reachability logic proof system is shown sound (i.e., partially correct) and
(relatively) complete.
Reachability logic thus eliminates the need to independently define an axiomatic
and an operational semantics for each language, and the non-negligible effort to
prove the former sound and complete w.r.t. the latter.
The soundness result has also been formalized in Coq, allowing reachability
logic derivations to serve as formal proof certificates that rely only on the
operational semantics.
