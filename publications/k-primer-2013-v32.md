  abstract: This paper serves as a brief introduction to the K tool, a system for
    formally defining programming languages. It is shown how sequential or concurrent
    languages can be defined in K simply and modularly. These formal definitions automatically
    yield an interpreter for the language, as well as program analysis tools such
    as a state-space explorer.
