  abstract = {
We present a language-independent verification framework that can be
instantiated with an operational semantics to automatically
generate a program verifier.
The framework treats both the operational semantics and the program correctness
specifications as reachability rules between matching logic patterns, and uses
the sound and relatively complete reachability logic proof system to prove the
specifications using the semantics.
We instantiate the framework with the semantics of one academic language,
KernelC, as well as with three recent semantics of real-world languages,
C, Java, and JavaScript, developed independently.
We evaluate our approach empirically and show that the generated program
verifiers can check automatically the full functional correctness of
challenging heap-manipulating programs implementing operations on list and tree
data structures, like AVL trees.
This is the first approach that can turn the operational semantics of
real-world languages into correct-by-construction automatic verifiers.
