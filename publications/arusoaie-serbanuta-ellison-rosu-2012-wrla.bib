  abstract  = {
This paper presents an interface for achieving interactive executions of Maude terms by allowing console and file input/output (I/O) operations. This interface consists of a Maude API for I/O operations, a Java-based server offering I/O capabilities, and a communication protocol between the two implemented using the external objects concept and Maude's TCP sockets. This interface was evaluated as part of the K framework, providing interactive interpreter capabilities for executing and testing programs for multiple language definitions.
