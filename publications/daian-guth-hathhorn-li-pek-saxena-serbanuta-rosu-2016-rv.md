  abstract: 'We present a suite of runtime verification tools developed by Runtime
    Verification Inc.: RV-Match, RV-Predict, and RV-Monitor. RV-Match is a tool for
    checking C programs for undefined behavior and other common programmer mistakes.
    It is extracted from the most complete formal semantics of the C11 language and
    beats many similar tools in its ability to catch a broad range of undesirable
    behaviors. RV-Predict is a dynamic data race detector for Java and C/C++ programs.
    It is perhaps the only tool that is both sound and maximal: it only reports real
    races and it can find all races that can be found by any other sound data race
    detector analyzing the same execution trace. RV-Monitor is a runtime monitoring
    tool that checks and enforces safety and security properties during program execution.
    Our tools focus on reporting no false positives and are free for non-commercial
    use.'
