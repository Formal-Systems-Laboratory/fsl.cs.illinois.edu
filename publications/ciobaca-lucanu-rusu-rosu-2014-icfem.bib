  abstract  = {
  Two programs are mutually equivalent if they both diverge or they
  both terminate with the same result.  In this
  paper we introduce a language-independent proof system for mutual
  equivalence, which is parametric in the operational semantics of two
  languages and in a state-similarity relation.
  We illustrate it on two
  programs in two different languages (an imperative one and a
  functional one), that both compute the Collatz sequence.
