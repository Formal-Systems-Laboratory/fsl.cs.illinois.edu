  abstract  = {This paper gives an overview of the tool-supported K framework for 
semantics-based programming language design and formal analysis.
K provides a convenient notation for modularly defining the syntax
and the semantics of a programming language, together with a series of tools
based on these, including a parser and an interpreter.
A case study is also discussed, namely the K definition of the dynamic and
static semantics of SIMPLE, a non-trivial imperative programming language.
The material discussed in this paper was presented in an invited talk at the
K'11 workshop.},
