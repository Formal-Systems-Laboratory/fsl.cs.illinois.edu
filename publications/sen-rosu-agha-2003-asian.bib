  title     = {Generating Optimal Linear Temporal Logic Monitors by Coinduction},
  abstract  = {
 A coinduction-based technique to generate an optimal monitor
from a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula is presented in this
paper. Such a monitor receives a sequence of states (one at a
time) from a running process, checks them against a requirements
specification expressed as an LTL formula, and determines whether
the formula has been violated or validated.  It can also say
whether the LTL formula is not monitorable any longer, i.e., that
the formula can in the future neither be violated nor be
validated.  A Web interface for the presented algorithm adapted to
extended regular expressions is available.
