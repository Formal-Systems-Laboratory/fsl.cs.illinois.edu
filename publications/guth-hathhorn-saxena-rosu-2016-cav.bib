  abstract  = {
We present RV-Match, a tool for checking C programs for undefined behavior and
other common programmer mistakes.
Our tool is extracted from the most complete formal semantics of the C11
language.
Previous versions of this tool were used primarily for testing the correctness
of the semantics, but we have improved it into a tool for doing practical
analysis of real C programs.
It beats many similar tools in its ability to catch a broad range of
undesirable behaviors.
We demonstrate this with comparisons based on a third-party benchmark.},
