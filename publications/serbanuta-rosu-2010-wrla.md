abstract: K is a rewriting-based framework for defining programming languages. K-Maude
  is a tool implementing K on top of Maude. K-Maude provides an interface accepting
  K modules along with regular Maude modules and a collection of tools for transforming
  K language definitions into Maude rewrite theories for execution or analysis, or
  into LaTeX for documentation purposes. The current K-Maude prototype was successfully
  used in defining several languages and language analysis tools, both for research
  and for teaching purposes. This paper describes the K-Maude tool, both from a user
  and from an implementer perspective.
