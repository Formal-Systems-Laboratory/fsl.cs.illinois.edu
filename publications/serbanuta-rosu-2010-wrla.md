  abstract: K is a rewriting-based framework for defining programming languages. K-Maude
    is a tool implementing K on top of Maude. K-Maude provides an interface accepting
    K modules along with regular Maude modules and a collection of tools for transforming
    K language definitions into Maude rewrite theories for execution or analysis,
    or into LaTeX for documentation purposes. The current K-Maude prototype was successfully
    used in defining several languages and language analysis tools, both for research
    and for teaching purposes. This paper describes the K-Maude tool, both from a
    user and from an implementer perspective.
