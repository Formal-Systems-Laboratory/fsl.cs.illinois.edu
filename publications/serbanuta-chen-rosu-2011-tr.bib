  abstract = {
This paper shows that it is possible to build a maximal and sound
causal model for concurrent computations from a given execution trace. It
is sound, in the sense that any program which can generate a trace can
also generate all traces in its causal model. It is maximal (among sound
models), in the sense that by extending the causal model of an observed
trace with a new trace, the model becomes unsound: there exists a program
generating the original trace which cannot generate the newly introduced
trace. Thus, the maximal sound model has the property that it comprises
all traces which all programs that can generate the original trace can
also generate. The existence of such a model is of great theoretical value.
First, it can be used to prove the soundness of non-maximal, and thus
smaller, causal models. Second, since it is maximal, the proposed model
allows for natural and causal-model-independent definitions of trace-based
properties; this paper proposes maximal definitions for causal dataraces
and causal atomicity. Finally, although defined axiomatically, the set
of traces comprised by the proposed model are shown to be effectively
constructed from the original trace. Thus, maximal causal models are also
amenable for developing practical analysis tools.
