  abstract: This paper presents a verification framework that is parametric in a (trusted)
    operational semantics of some programming language. The underlying proof system
    is language-independent and consists of eight proof rules. The proof system is
    proved partially correct and relatively complete (with respect to the programming
    language configuration model). To show its practicality, the generic framework
    is instantiated with a fragment of C and evaluated with encouraging results.
