abstract: This paper presents a verification framework that is parametric in a (trusted)
  operational semantics of some programming language. The underlying proof system
  is language-independent and consists of eight proof rules. The proof system is proved
  partially correct and relatively complete (with respect to the programming language
  configuration model). To show its practicality, the generic framework is instantiated
  with a fragment of C and evaluated with encouraging results.
