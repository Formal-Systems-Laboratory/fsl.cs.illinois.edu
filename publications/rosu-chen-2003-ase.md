  abstract: Measurement unit safety policy checking is a topic in software analysis
    concerned with ensuring that programs do not violate basic principles of units
    of measurement. Such violations can hide significant domain-specific errors which
    are hard or impossible to find otherwise. Measurement unit analysis by means of
    automatic deduction is addressed in this paper. We draw general design principles
    for measurement unit certification tools and discuss our prototype for the C language,
    which includes both dynamic and static checkers. Our approach is based on assume/assert
    annotations of code, which are properly interpreted by our deduction-based tools
    and ignored by standard compilers. We do not modify the language in order to support
    units. The approach can be extended to incorporate other safety policies without
    great efforts.
