Analysis of execution traces plays a fundamental role in many program
analysis approaches, such as runtime verification, testing, monitoring, and
specification mining. Execution traces are frequently parametric, i.e., they
contain events with parameter bindings. Each parametric trace usually
consists of many meaningful trace slices merged together, each slice
corresponding to one parameter binding. This gives a semantics-based
solution to parametric trace analysis. A general-purpose parametric trace
slicing technique is introduced, which takes each event in the parametric
trace and dispatches it to its corresponding trace slices. This parametric
trace slicing technique can be used in combination with any conventional,
non-parametric trace analysis technique, by applying the later on each
trace slice. As an instance, a parametric property monitoring technique is then
presented. The presented parametric trace slicing and monitoring techniques have
been implemented and extensively evaluated. Measurements of runtime
overhead confirm that the generality of the discussed techniques does not come
at a performance expense when compared with existing parametric trace
monitoring systems.
