  abstract: Proof-checking code for compliance to safety policies potentially enables
    a product-oriented approach to certain aspects of software certification. To date,
    previous research has focused on generic, low-level programming-language properties
    such as memory type safety. In this paper we consider proof-checking higher-level
    domain-specific properties for compliance to safety policies. The paper first
    describes a framework related to abstract interpretation in which compliance to
    a class of certification policies can be efficiently calculated. Membership equational
    logic is shown to provide a rich logic for carrying out such calculations, including
    partiality, for certification. The architecture for a domain-specific certifier
    is described, followed by an implemented case study. The case study considers
    consistency of abstract variable attributes in code that performs geometric calculations
    in Aerospace systems.
