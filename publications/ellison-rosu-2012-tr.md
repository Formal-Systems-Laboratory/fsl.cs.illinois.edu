  abstract: This paper investigates undefined behavior in C and offers a few simple
    techniques for operationally specifying such behavior formally. A semantics-based
    undefinedness checker for C is developed using these techniques, as well as a
    test suite of undefined programs. The tool is evaluated against other popular
    analysis tools, using the new test suite in addition to a third-party test suite.
    The semantics-based tool performs at least as well or better than the other tools
    tested.
