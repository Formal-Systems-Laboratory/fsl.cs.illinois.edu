  abstract: This paper proposes a logic for programming languages, which is both simple
    and expressive, to serve as a foundation for language semantics frameworks. Matching
    mu-logic has been recently proposed as a unifying foundation for programming languages,
    specification and verification. It has been shown to capture several logics important
    for programming languages, including first-order logic with least fixpoints, separation
    logic, temporal logics, modal mu-logic, and importantly, reachability logic, a
    language-independent logic for program verification that subsumes Hoare logic.
    This paper identifies a fragment of matching mu-logic called applicative matching
    logic (AML), which is much simpler and thus more appealing from a foundational
    perspective, yet as expressive as matching mu-logic. Several additional logical
    frameworks fundamental for programming languages are shown to be faithfully captured
    by AML, including many- and order-sorted algebras, lambda-calculus, (dependent)
    type systems, evaluation contexts, and rewriting. Finally, it is shown how all
    these make AML an appropriate underlying logic foundation for complex language
    semantics frameworks, such as K.
