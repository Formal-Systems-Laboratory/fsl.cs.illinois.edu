abstract: This paper proposes a logic for programming languages, which is both simple
  and expressive, to serve as a foundation for language semantics frameworks. Matching
  mu-logic has been recently proposed as a unifying foundation for programming languages,
  specification and verification. It has been shown to capture several logics important
  for programming languages, including first-order logic with least fixpoints, separation
  logic, temporal logics, modal mu-logic, and importantly, reachability logic, a language-independent
  logic for program verification that subsumes Hoare logic. This paper identifies
  a fragment of matching mu-logic called applicative matching logic (AML), which is
  much simpler and thus more appealing from a foundational perspective, yet as expressive
  as matching mu-logic. Several additional logical frameworks fundamental for programming
  languages are shown to be faithfully captured by AML, including many- and order-sorted
  algebras, lambda-calculus, (dependent) type systems, evaluation contexts, and rewriting.
  Finally, it is shown how all these make AML an appropriate underlying logic foundation
  for complex language semantics frameworks, such as K.
