  abstract: We present RV-Match, a tool for checking C programs for undefined behavior
    and other common programmer mistakes. Our tool is extracted from the most complete
    formal semantics of the C11 language. Previous versions of this tool were used
    primarily for testing the correctness of the semantics, but we have improved it
    into a tool for doing practical analysis of real C programs. It beats many similar
    tools in its ability to catch a broad range of undesirable behaviors. We demonstrate
    this with comparisons based on a third-party benchmark.
