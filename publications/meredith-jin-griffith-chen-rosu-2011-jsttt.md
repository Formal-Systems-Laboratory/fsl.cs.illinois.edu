  abstract: 'This article gives an overview of the Monitoring Oriented Programming
    framework (MOP). In MOP, runtime monitoring is supported and encouraged as a fundamental
    principle for building reliable systems. Monitors are automatically synthesized
    from specified properties and are used in conjunction with the original system
    to check its dynamic behaviors. When a specification is violated or validated
    at runtime, user-defined actions will be triggered, which can be any code, such
    as information logging or runtime recovery. Two instances of MOP are presented:
    JavaMOP (for Java programs) and BusMOP (for monitoring PCI bus traffic). The architecture
    of MOP is discussed, and an explanation of parametric trace monitoring and its
    implementation is given. A comprehensive evaluation of JavaMOP attests to its
    efficiency, especially in comparison with similar systems. The implementation
    of BusMOP is discussed in detail. In general, BusMOP imposes no runtime overhead
    on the system it is monitoring.'
