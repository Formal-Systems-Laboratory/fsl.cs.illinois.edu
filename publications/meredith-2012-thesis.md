  abstract: Runtime Verification is a quickly growing technique for providing many
    of the guarantees of formal verification, but in a manner that is scalable. It
    useful information available from actual runs of programs to make verification
    decisions, rather than the purely static information used in formal verification.
    One of the main facets of Runtime Verification is runtime monitoring, where safety
    properties are checked against the execution of a program during (or in some cases
    after) its run. Prior work on efficient monitoring focused primarily on finite
    state properties. Non-finite state techniques existed, but added orders of magnitude
    of runtime overhead on the monitored system. The vast majority of runtime monitoring
    has also been limited to the application domain, with violations of safety properties
    only found on the actual trace of a given program. This thesis describes research
    that demonstrates that various logical formalisms, including those more powerful
    than finite logics, can be efficiently monitored in multiple monitoring domains.
    The demonstrated monitoring domains run the gamut from the application level with
    the Java programming language, to monitoring traces \emph{predicted} from a given
    run of a program, to hardware based monitors designed to ensure proper peripheral
    operation. The logical formalisms include multicategory finite state machines,
    extended regular expressions, past-time linear temporal logic with optimization
    for hardware based monitors, context-free grammars, linear temporal logic with
    both past and future operators, and string rewriting. This combination of domains
    and logical formalisms show that monitoring can be both expressive and efficient,
    regardless of the expressive power of the logical formalism, and that monitoring
    can be used not only for flat traces generated by software applications, but also
    in predictive traces and a hardware context.
