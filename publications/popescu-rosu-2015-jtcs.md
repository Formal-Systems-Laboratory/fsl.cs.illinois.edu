  abstract: We introduce term-generic logic (TGL), a first-order logic parameterized
    with terms defined axiomatically (rather than constructively), by requiring terms
    to only provide free variable and substitution operators satisfying some reasonable
    axioms. TGL has a notion of model that generalizes both first-order models and
    Henkin models of the lambda-calculus. The abstract notions of term syntax and
    model are shown to be sufficient for obtaining the completeness theorem of a Gentzen
    system generalizing that of first-order logic. Various systems featuring bindings
    and contextual reasoning, ranging from pure type systems to the pi-calculus, are
    captured as theories inside TGL. For two particular, but rather typical instances---untyped
    lambda-calculus and System F---the general-purpose TGL models are shown to be
    equivalent with standard ad hoc models.
