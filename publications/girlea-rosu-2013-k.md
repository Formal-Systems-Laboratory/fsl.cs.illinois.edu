  abstract: A structured K definition is easier to write, understand and debug than
    one single module containing the whole definition. Furthermore, modularization
    makes it easy to reuse work between definitions that share some principles or
    features. Therefore, it is useful to have a semantics for module composition operations
    that allows the properties of the resulting modules to be well understood at every
    step of the composition process. This paper presents an abstract semantics for
    a module system proposal for the K framework. It describes K modules and module
    transformations in terms of institution-based model theory introduced by Goguen
    and Burstall.
