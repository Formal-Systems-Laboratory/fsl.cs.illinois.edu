abstract: A structured K definition is easier to write, understand and debug than
  one single module containing the whole definition. Furthermore, modularization makes
  it easy to reuse work between definitions that share some principles or features.
  Therefore, it is useful to have a semantics for module composition operations that
  allows the properties of the resulting modules to be well understood at every step
  of the composition process. This paper presents an abstract semantics for a module
  system proposal for the K framework. It describes K modules and module transformations
  in terms of institution-based model theory introduced by Goguen and Burstall.
