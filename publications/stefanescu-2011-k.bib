               Framework},
  abstract  = {
This paper presents MatchC, a matching logic reachability verifier using the K
framework. K is a rewriting-based framework for defining and analyzing
programming languages. Matching logic is a logic designed to state and reason
about structural properties over arbitrary program configurations. Matching
logic reachability is a unifying framework for operational and axiomatic
semantics of programing languages. The MatchC verifier
(http://matching-logic.org/) checks reachability properties of programs written
in a deterministic fragment of C and is implemented in the K framework. This
paper discusses the correctness of the implementation of the matching logic
reachability proof system in MatchC. The main contributions of this paper are
the implementation of the verifier, with emphasis on using K for program
verification, and the evaluation of the tool on a large number of programs,
including complex ones, like programs implementing the AVL trees data structure
and the Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm.
