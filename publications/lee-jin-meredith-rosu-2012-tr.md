  abstract: Formal specification of correct library usage is extremely useful, both
    for software developers and for the formal analysis tools they use, such as model
    checkers or runtime monitoring systems. Unfortunately, the process of creating
    formal specifications is time consuming, and, for the most part, even the libraries
    in greatest use, such as the Java Development Kit (JDK) standard library, are
    left wholly without formal specification. This paper presents a tool-supported
    approach to help writing formal specifications for Java libraries and creating
    documentation augmented with highlighting and formal specifications. The presented
    approach has been applied to systematically and completely formalize the runtime
    properties of three core and commonly used packages of the JDK API, namely java.io,
    java.lang and java.util, yielding 137 formal specifications. Indirectly, this
    paper also brings empirical evidence that parametric specifications may be sufficiently
    powerful to express virtually all desirable runtime properties of the JDK API,
    and that its informal documentation can be formalized.
