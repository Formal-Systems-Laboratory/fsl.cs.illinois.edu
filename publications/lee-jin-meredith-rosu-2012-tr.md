abstract: Formal specification of correct library usage is extremely useful, both
  for software developers and for the formal analysis tools they use, such as model
  checkers or runtime monitoring systems. Unfortunately, the process of creating formal
  specifications is time consuming, and, for the most part, even the libraries in
  greatest use, such as the Java Development Kit (JDK) standard library, are left
  wholly without formal specification. This paper presents a tool-supported approach
  to help writing formal specifications for Java libraries and creating documentation
  augmented with highlighting and formal specifications. The presented approach has
  been applied to systematically and completely formalize the runtime properties of
  three core and commonly used packages of the JDK API, namely java.io, java.lang
  and java.util, yielding 137 formal specifications. Indirectly, this paper also brings
  empirical evidence that parametric specifications may be sufficiently powerful to
  express virtually all desirable runtime properties of the JDK API, and that its
  informal documentation can be formalized.
