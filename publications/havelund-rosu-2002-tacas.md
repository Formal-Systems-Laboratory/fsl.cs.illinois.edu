  abstract: The problem of testing a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula on a finite
    execution trace of events, generated by an executing program, occurs naturally
    in runtime analysis of software. An algorithm which takes a past time LTL formula
    and generates an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is presented. The generated
    algorithm tests whether the formula is satisfied by a finite trace of events given
    as input and runs in linear time, its constant depending on the size of the LTL
    formula. The memory needed is constant, also depending on the size of the formula.
    Further optimizations of the algorithm are suggested. Past time operators suitable
    for writing succinct specifications are introduced and shown definitionally equivalent
    to the standard operators. This work is part of the PathExplorer project, the
    objective of which it is to construct a flexible framework for monitoring and
    analyzing program executions.
