  abstract = {
In this paper, we present a formal verification tool for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode.
To precisely reason about all possible behaviors of the EVM bytecode, we adopted KEVM, a complete formal semantics of the EVM, and instantiated the K-framework's reachability logic theorem prover to generate a correct-by-construction deductive verifier for the EVM.
We further optimized the verifier by introducing EVM-specific abstractions and lemmas to improve its scalability.
Our EVM verifier has been used to verify various high-profile smart contracts including the ERC20 token, Ethereum Casper, and DappHub MakerDAO contracts.
