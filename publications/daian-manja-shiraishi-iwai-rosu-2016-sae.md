  abstract: The Runtime Verification ECU (RV-ECU) is a new development platform for
    checking and enforcing the safety of automotive bus communications and software
    systems. RV-ECU uses runtime verification, a formal analysis subfield geared at
    validating and verifying systems as they run, to ensure that all manufacturer
    and third-party safety specifications are complied with during the operation of
    the vehicle. By compiling formal safety properties into code using a certifying
    compiler, the RV-ECU executes only provably correct code that checks for safety
    violations as the system runs. RV-ECU can also recover from violations of these
    properties, either by itself in simple cases or together with safe message-sending
    libraries implementable on third-party control units on the bus. RV-ECU can be
    updated with new specifications after a vehicle is released, enhancing the safety
    of vehicles that have already been sold and deployed. Currently a prototype, RV-ECU
    is meant to eventually be deployed as global and local ECU safety monitors, ultimately
    responsible for the safety of the entire vehicle system. We describe its overall
    architecture and implementation, and demonstrate monitoring of safety specifications
    on the CAN bus. We use past automotive recalls as case studies to demonstrate
    the potential of updating the RV-ECU as a cost effective and practical alternative
    to software recalls, while requiring the development of rigorous, formal safety
    specifications easily sharable across manufacturers, OEMs, regulatory agencies
    and even car owners.
