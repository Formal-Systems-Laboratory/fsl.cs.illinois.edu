  abstract  = {
K is a rewriting-based framework for defining programming languages. K-Maude is a tool implementing K on top of Maude. K-Maude provides an interface accepting K modules along with regular Maude modules and a collection of tools for transforming K language definitions into Maude rewrite theories for execution or analysis, or into LaTeX for documentation purposes. The current K-Maude prototype was successfully used in defining several languages and language analysis tools, both for research and for teaching purposes. This paper describes the K-Maude tool, both from a user and from an implementer perspective.
