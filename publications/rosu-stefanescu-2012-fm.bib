  abstract  = {
Matching logic reachability has been recently proposed as an alternative program
verification approach.
Unlike Hoare logic, where one defines a language-specific proof system that
needs to be proved sound for each language separately, matching logic
reachability provides a *language-independent* and *sound* proof system that
directly uses the trusted operational semantics of the language as axioms.
Matching logic reachability thus has a clear practical advantage: it eliminates
the need for an additional semantics of the same language in order to reason
about programs, and implicitly eliminates the need for tedious soundness proofs.
What is not clear, however, is whether matching logic reachability is as
powerful as Hoare logic.
This paper introduces a technique to mechanically translate Hoare logic proof
derivations into equivalent matching logic reachability proof derivations.
The presented technique has two consequences: first, it suggests that matching
logic reachability has no theoretical limitation over Hoare logic; and second,
it provides a new approach to prove Hoare logics sound.
