  abstract: Monitoring-Oriented Programming (MOP) helps develop more reliable software
    by means of monitoring against formal specifications. While MOP showed promising
    results, all prior research has focused on checking a single version of a target
    software application. We propose to extend MOP to support multiple software versions
    and thus be more relevant in the context of rapid software evolution. Our approach,
    called eMOP, is inspired by regression test selection---a well studied, evolution-centered
    technique. The key idea in eMOP is to monitor only the parts of code that changed
    between versions. We illustrate eMOP by means of a running example, and show the
    results of preliminary experiments. eMOP opens up a new line of research on MOP---it
    can significantly improve usability and performance when applied across multiple
    versions of an application, and is complementary to algorithmic MOP advances on
    single versions.
