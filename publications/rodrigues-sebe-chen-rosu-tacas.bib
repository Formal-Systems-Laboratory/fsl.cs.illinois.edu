  abstract  = {
We present a sound and complete axiomatization of finite words using
matching logic. A unique feature of our axiomatization is that it gives
a \emph{shallow embedding} of regular expressions into matching logic,
and a \emph{logical} representation of finite automata. The semantics of
both expressions and automata are precisely captured as matching logic
formulae that evaluate to the corresponding language. Regular
expressions are matching logic formulae \emph{as is}, while the
embedding of automata is a \emph{structural analog}---computational
aspects of automata are captured as syntactic features. We demonstrate
that our axiomatization is sound and complete by showing that runs of
Brzozowski's procedure for equivalence checking correspond to matching
logic proofs. We propose this as a general methodology for producing
machine-checkable formal proofs, enabled by capturing structural analogs
of computational artifacts in logic. The proofs produced can be
efficiently checked by the Metamath Zero verifier. Work presented in
this paper contributes to the general scheme of achieving verifiable
computing via logical methods, where computations are reduced to logical
reasoning, encoded as machine-checkable proof objects, and checked by a
trusted proof checker.
