  abstract: This paper gives an overview of the tool-supported K framework for semantics-based
    programming language design and formal analysis. K provides a convenient notation
    for modularly defining the syntax and the semantics of a programming language,
    together with a series of tools based on these, including a parser and an interpreter.
    A case study is also discussed, namely the K definition of the dynamic and static
    semantics of SIMPLE, a non-trivial imperative programming language. The material
    discussed in this paper was presented in an invited talk at the K'11 workshop.
