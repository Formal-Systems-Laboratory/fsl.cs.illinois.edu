  abstract: As the systems we have to specify and verify become larger and more complex,
    there is a mounting need to combine different tools and decision procedures to
    accomplish large proof tasks. The problem, then, is how to be sure that we can
    trust the correctness of a heterogeneous proof. In this work we focus on certification
    and synthesis of equational proofs, that are pervasive in most proof tasks and
    for which many tools are poorly equipped. Fortunately, equational proof engines
    like ELAN and Maude can perform millions of equational proof steps per second
    which, if certified by proof objects, can be trusted by other tools. We present
    a general method to certify and synthesize proofs in membership equational logic,
    where the synthesis may involve generating full proofs from proof traces modulo
    combinations of associativity, commutativity, and identity axioms. We propose
    a simple representation for proof objects and give algorithms that can synthesize
    space-efficient, machine-checkable proof objects from proof traces.
