  abstract: 'Two programs are fully equivalent if, for the same input, either they
    both diverge or they both terminate with the same result. Full equivalence is
    an adequate notion of equivalence for programs written in deterministic languages.
    It is useful in many contexts, such as capturing the correctness of program transformations
    within the same language, or capturing the correctness of compilers between two
    different languages. In this paper we introduce a language-independent proof system
    for full equivalence, which is parametric in the operational semantics of two
    languages and in a state-similarity relation. The proof system is sound: a proof
    tree establishes the full equivalence of the programs given to it as input. We
    illustrate it on two programs in two different languages (an imperative one and
    a functional one), that both compute the Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence
    is an interesting case study since it is not known weather the sequence terminates
    or not; nevertheless, our proof system shows that the two programs are fully equivalent
    (even if we cannot establish termination or divergence of either one).'
