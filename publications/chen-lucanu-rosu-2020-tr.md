  abstract: Matching logic is a unifying foundational logic for defining formal programming
    language semantics, which adopts a minimalist design with few primitive constructs
    that are enough to express all properties within a variety of logical systems,
    including FOL, separation logic, (dependent) type systems, modal mu-logic, and
    more. In this paper, we consider initial algebra semantics and show how to capture
    it by matching logic specifications. Formally, given an algebraic specification
    E that defines a set of sorts (of data) and a set of operations whose behaviors
    are defined by a set of equational axioms, we define a corresponding matching
    logic specification, denoted INITIALALGEBRA(E), whose models are exactly the initial
    algebras of E. Thus, we reduce initial E-algebra semantics to the matching logic
    specifications INITIALALGEBRA(E), and reduce extrinsic initial E-algebra reasoning,
    which includes inductive reasoning, to generic, intrinsic matching logic reasoning.
