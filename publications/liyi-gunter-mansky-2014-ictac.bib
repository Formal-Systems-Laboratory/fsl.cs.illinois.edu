Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a well-known formal
language for describing concurrent systems, where transition
semantics for it has been given by Brookes, Hoare and
Roscoe.
In this paper, we present trace
refinement model analysis tools based on a generalized transition
semantics of CSP, which we call HCSP, that merges the original
transition system with ideas from Floyd-Hoare Logic and symbolic
computation. This generalized semantics is shown to be sound and
complete with respect to the original trace semantics. Traces in our
system are symbolic representations of families of traces as given by
the original semantics. This more compact representation allows us to
expand the original CSP systems to effectively and efficiently model
check some CSP programs that are difficult or impossible for other CSP
systems to analyze. In particular, our system can handle certain
classes of non-deterministic choices as a single transition, while the
original semantics would treat each choice separately, possibly
leading to large or unbounded case analyses. All work described in
this paper has been carried out in the theorem prover Isabelle. This then provides us with a framework for automated and interactive
analysis of CSP processes. It also gives us the ability to extract
Ocaml code for an HCSP-based simulator directly from Isabelle. Based on the HCSP semantics and traditional trace refinement,
we develop an idea of symbolic trace refinement and build a model checker based on it.
The
model checker was transcribed by hand into
Maude as automatic extraction of
Maude code is not yet supported by the Isabelle system.
