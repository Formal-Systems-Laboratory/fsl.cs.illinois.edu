 title  = {Abstract Semantics for K Module Composition},
  abstract  = {A structured K definition is easier to write, understand and debug than one
single module containing the whole definition.
Furthermore, modularization makes it easy to reuse work between definitions
that share some principles or features.
Therefore, it is useful to have a semantics for module composition operations
that allows the properties of the resulting modules to be well understood at
every step of the composition process.
This paper presents an abstract semantics for a module system proposal for
the K framework.
It describes K modules and module transformations in terms of
institution-based model theory introduced by Goguen and Burstall.},
