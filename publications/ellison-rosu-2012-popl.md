  abstract: This paper describes an executable formal semantics of C. Being executable,
    the semantics has been thoroughly tested against the GCC torture test suite and
    successfully passes 99.2\% of 776 test programs. It is the most complete and thoroughly
    tested formal definition of C to date. The semantics yields an interpreter, debugger,
    state space search tool, and model checker "for free". The semantics is shown
    capable of automatically finding program errors, both statically and at runtime.
    It is also used to enumerate nondeterministic behavior.
