  abstract: This paper presents an interface for achieving interactive executions
    of Maude terms by allowing console and file input/output (I/O) operations. This
    interface consists of a Maude API for I/O operations, a Java-based server offering
    I/O capabilities, and a communication protocol between the two implemented using
    the external objects concept and Maude's TCP sockets. This interface was evaluated
    as part of the K framework, providing interactive interpreter capabilities for
    executing and testing programs for multiple language definitions.
