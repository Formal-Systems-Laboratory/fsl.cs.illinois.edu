  abstract: K is a formal framework for defining the operational semantics of programming
    languages. It includes software tools for compiling K language definitions to
    Maude rewrite theories, for executing programs in the defined languages based
    on the Maude rewriting engine, and for analyzing programs by adapting various
    Maude analysis tools. A recent extension to the K tool suite is an automatic transformation
    of language definitions that enables the symbolic execution of programs, i.e.,
    the execution of programs with symbolic inputs. In this paper we investigate the
    theoretical relationships between K language definitions and their translations
    to Maude, between symbolic extensions of K definitions and their Maude encodings,
    and how the relations between K definitions and their symbolic extensions are
    reflected on their respective representations in Maude. These results show, in
    particular, how analyses performed with Maude tools can be formally lifted up
    to the original language definitions.
