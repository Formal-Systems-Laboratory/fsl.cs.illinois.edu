abstract: K is a formal framework for defining the operational semantics of programming
  languages. It includes software tools for compiling K language definitions to Maude
  rewrite theories, for executing programs in the defined languages based on the Maude
  rewriting engine, and for analyzing programs by adapting various Maude analysis
  tools. A recent extension to the K tool suite is an automatic transformation of
  language definitions that enables the symbolic execution of programs, i.e., the
  execution of programs with symbolic inputs. In this paper we investigate the theoretical
  relationships between K language definitions and their translations to Maude, between
  symbolic extensions of K definitions and their Maude encodings, and how the relations
  between K definitions and their symbolic extensions are reflected on their respective
  representations in Maude. These results show, in particular, how analyses performed
  with Maude tools can be formally lifted up to the original language definitions.
