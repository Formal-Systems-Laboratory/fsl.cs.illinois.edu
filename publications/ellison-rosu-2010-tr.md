  abstract: This paper describes an executable formal semantics of C expressed using
    a formalism based on term rewriting. Being executable, the semantics has been
    thoroughly tested against the GCC torture test suite and successfully passes over
    96\% of 715 test programs. It is the most complete and thoroughly tested formal
    definition of C to date. The semantics yields an interpreter, debugger, and state
    space search tool "for free". The semantics is shown capable of automatically
    finding program errors, both statically and at runtime. It is also used to enumerate
    nondeterministic behavior. These techniques together allow the tool to identify
    undefined programs.
