  abstract: K framework is an effort in realizing the ideal language framework where
    programming languages must have formal semantics and all languages tools are automatically
    generated from the formal semantics in a correct-by-construction manner at no
    additional costs. In this extended abstract, we present matching mu-logic as the
    foundation of K and discuss some of its applications in defining constructors,
    transition systems, modal mu-logic and temporal logic variants, and reachability
    logic.
