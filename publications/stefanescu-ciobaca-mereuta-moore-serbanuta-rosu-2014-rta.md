  abstract: This paper presents a language-independent proof system for reachability
    properties of programs written in non-deterministic (e.g. concurrent) languages,
    referred to as *all-path reachability logic*. It derives partial-correctness properties
    with all-path semantics (a state satisfying a given precondition reaches states
    satisfying a given postcondition on all terminating execution paths). The proof
    system takes as axioms any unconditional operational semantics, and is sound (partially
    correct) and (relatively) complete, independent of the object language; the soundness
    has also been mechanized (Coq). This approach is implemented in a tool for semantics-based
    verification as part of the K framework.
