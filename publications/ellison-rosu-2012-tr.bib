  abstract = {
This paper investigates undefined behavior in C and offers a few simple techniques for operationally specifying such behavior formally. A semantics-based undefinedness checker for C is developed using these techniques, as well as a test suite of undefined programs. The tool is evaluated against other popular analysis tools, using the new test suite in addition to a third-party test suite. The semantics-based tool performs at least as well or better than the other tools tested.
