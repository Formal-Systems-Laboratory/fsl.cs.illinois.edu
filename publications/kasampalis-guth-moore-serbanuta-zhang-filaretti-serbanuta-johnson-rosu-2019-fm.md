  abstract: This paper proposes IELE, an LLVM-style language, together with a tool
    ecosystem for implementing and formally reasoning about smart contracts on the
    blockchain. IELE was designed by specifying its semantics formally in the K framework.
    Its implementation, a IELE virtual machine (VM), as well as a formal verification
    tool for IELE smart contracts, were automatically generated from the formal specification.
    The automatically generated formal verification tool allows us to formally verify
    smart contracts without any gap between the verifier and the actual VM. A compiler
    from Solidity, the predominant high- level language for smart contracts, to IELE
    has also been (manually) implemented, so Ethereum contracts can now also be executed
    on IELE.
