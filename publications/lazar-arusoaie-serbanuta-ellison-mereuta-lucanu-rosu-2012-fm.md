abstract: This paper describes the K tool, a system for formally defining programming
  languages. Formal definitions created using the K tool automatically yield an interpreter
  for the language, as well as program analysis tools such as a state-space explorer.
  The modularity of K and the design of the tool allow one semantics to be used for
  several applications.
