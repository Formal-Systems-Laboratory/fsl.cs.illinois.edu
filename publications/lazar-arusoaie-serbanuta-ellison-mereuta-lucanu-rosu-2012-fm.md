  abstract: This paper describes the K tool, a system for formally defining programming
    languages. Formal definitions created using the K tool automatically yield an
    interpreter for the language, as well as program analysis tools such as a state-space
    explorer. The modularity of K and the design of the tool allow one semantics to
    be used for several applications.
