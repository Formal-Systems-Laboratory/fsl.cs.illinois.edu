  abstract  = {
  Program execution traces can be so large in practical testing and
  monitoring applications that it would be very expensive, if not
  impossible, to store them for detailed analysis.  Monitoring
  execution traces {\em without storing} them, can be a nontrivial
  matter for many specification formalisms, because complex formulae
  may require a considerable amount of information about the past.
  {\em Metric temporal logic} (MTL) is an extension of propositional
  linear temporal logic with discrete-time-bounded temporal operators.
  In MTL, one can specify time limits within which certain temporal
  properties must hold, thus making it very suitable to express
  real-time monitoring requirements.  In this paper, we present
  monitoring algorithms for checking timestamped execution traces
  against formulae in MTL or certain important sublogics of it.  We
  also present lower bounds for the monitoring problem, showing that
  the presented algorithms are asymptotically optimal.
