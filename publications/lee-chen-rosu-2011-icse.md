  abstract: 'Specifications carrying formal parameters that are bound to concrete
    data at runtime can effectively and elegantly capture multi-object behaviors or
    protocols. Unfortunately, parametric specifications are not easy to formulate
    by non-experts and, consequently, are rarely available. This paper presents a
    general approach for mining parametric specifications from program executions,
    based on a strict separation of concerns: (1) a trace slicer first extracts sets
    of independent interactions from parametric execution traces; and (2) the resulting
    non-parametric trace slices are then passed to any conventional non-parametric
    property learner. The presented technique has been implemented in jMiner, which
    has been used to automatically mine many meaningful and non-trivial parametric
    properties of OpenJDK 6.'
