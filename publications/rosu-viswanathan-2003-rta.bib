  abstract  = {
In this paper we present lower bounds and rewriting algorithms for
testing membership of a word in a regular language described by an
extended regular expression.  Motivated by intuitions from monitoring
and testing, where the words to be tested (execution traces) are
typically much longer than the size of the regular expressions
(patterns or requirements), and by the fact that in many applications
the traces are only available incrementally, on an event by event
basis, our algorithms are based on an event-consumption idea: a just
arrived event is ``consumed'' by the regular expression, i.e., the
regular expression modifies itself into another expression discarding
the event.  We present an exponential space lower bound for monitoring
extended regular expressions and argue that the presented
rewriting-based algorithms, besides their simplicity and elegance, are
practical and almost as good as one can hope.  We experimented with
and evaluated our algorithms in Maude.
