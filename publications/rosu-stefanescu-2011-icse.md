  abstract: 'Matching logic is a new program verification logic, which builds upon
    operational semantics. Matching logic specifications are constrained symbolic
    program configurations, called patterns, which can be matched by concrete configurations.
    By building upon an operational semantics of the language and allowing specifications
    to directly refer to the structure of the configuration, matching logic has at
    least three benefits that could be key factors in its potential usability: (1)
    One''s familiarity with the formalism reduces to one''s familiarity with the operational
    semantics of the language, that is, with the language itself; (2) The verification
    process proceeds the same way as the execution of the program, making debugging
    failed proof attempts manageable because one can always see the ``current configuration
    and ``what went wrong, same like in a debugger; and (3) Nothing is lost in translation,
    that is, there is no gap between the language itself and its verifier. Moreover,
    direct access to the structure of the configuration facilitates defining sub-patterns
    that one may reason about, such as disjoint lists or trees in the heap, as well
    as supporting framing in various components of the configuration at no additional
    costs.'
