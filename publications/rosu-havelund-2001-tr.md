  abstract: The problem of testing a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula on a finite
    execution trace of events, generated by an executing program, occurs naturally
    in runtime analysis of software. We present an algorithm which takes an LTL formula
    and generates an efficient dynamic programming algorithm. The generated algorithm
    tests whether the LTL formula is satisfied by a finite trace of events given as
    input. The generated algorithm runs in linear time, its constant depending on
    the size of the LTL formula. The memory needed is constant, also depending on
    the size of the formula.
