abstract: Software security attacks represent an ever growing problem. One way to
  make software more secure is to use Inlined Reference Monitors (IRMs), which allow
  security specifications to be inlined inside a target program to ensure its compliance
  with the desired security specifications. The IRM approach has been developed primarily
  by the security community. Runtime Verification (RV), on the other hand, is a software
  engineering approach, which is intended to formally encode system specifications
  within a target program such that those specifications can be later enforced during
  the execution of the program. Until now, the IRM and RV approaches have lived separate
  lives; in particular RV techniques have not been applied to the security domain,
  being used instead to aid program correctness and testing. This paper discusses
  the usage of a formalism-generic RV system, JavaMOP, as a means to specify IRMs,
  leveraging the careful engineering of the JavaMOP system for ensuring secure operation
  of software in an efficient manner.
