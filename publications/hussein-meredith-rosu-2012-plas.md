  abstract: Software security attacks represent an ever growing problem. One way to
    make software more secure is to use Inlined Reference Monitors (IRMs), which allow
    security specifications to be inlined inside a target program to ensure its compliance
    with the desired security specifications. The IRM approach has been developed
    primarily by the security community. Runtime Verification (RV), on the other hand,
    is a software engineering approach, which is intended to formally encode system
    specifications within a target program such that those specifications can be later
    enforced during the execution of the program. Until now, the IRM and RV approaches
    have lived separate lives; in particular RV techniques have not been applied to
    the security domain, being used instead to aid program correctness and testing.
    This paper discusses the usage of a formalism-generic RV system, JavaMOP, as a
    means to specify IRMs, leveraging the careful engineering of the JavaMOP system
    for ensuring secure operation of software in an efficient manner.
