This report contains the complete lecture notes for CS322, Programming Language Design, taught by Grigore Rosu in the Fall 2003 semester at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. This large PDF document has been generated automatically from the CS322's website at: http://fsl.cs.uiuc.edu/~grosu/classes/2003/fall/cs322/.
Of particular importance is the novel technique for defining concurrent languages that starts at page 673, based on a first-order representation of computations (called "continuations" for simplicity there, though only their suffix is an actual "continuation structure").
