  abstract: Two programs are mutually equivalent if they both diverge or they both
    terminate with the same result. In this paper we introduce a language-independent
    proof system for mutual equivalence, which is parametric in the operational semantics
    of two languages and in a state-similarity relation. We illustrate it on two programs
    in two different languages (an imperative one and a functional one), that both
    compute the Collatz sequence.
