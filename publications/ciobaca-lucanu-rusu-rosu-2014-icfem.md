abstract: Two programs are mutually equivalent if they both diverge or they both terminate
  with the same result. In this paper we introduce a language-independent proof system
  for mutual equivalence, which is parametric in the operational semantics of two
  languages and in a state-similarity relation. We illustrate it on two programs in
  two different languages (an imperative one and a functional one), that both compute
  the Collatz sequence.
