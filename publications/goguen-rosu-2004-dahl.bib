  abstract  = {
This paper studies the composition of modules that can hide information, over
a very general class of logical systems called inclusive institutions.  Two
semantics are given for composition of such modules using five familiar
operations, and a property called conservativity is shown necessary and
sufficient for these semantics to agree.  The first semantics extracts the
visible properties of the result of composing the visible and hidden parts of
modules, while the second uses only the visible properties of the components;
the semantics agree when the visible consequences of hidden information are
enough to determine the result of the composition.  A number of laws of
software composition are proved relating the composition operations.
Inclusive institutions simplify many proofs.
