  abstract: 'Early efforts in runtime verification show that parametric regular and
    temporal logic specifications can be monitored efficiently. These approaches,
    however, have limited expressiveness: their specifications always reduce to monitors
    with finite state. More recent developments showed that parametric context-free
    properties can be efficiently monitored with overheads generally lower than 12-15%.
    While context-free grammars are more expressive than finite-state languages, they
    still do not allow every computable safety property. This paper presents a monitor
    synthesis algorithm for string rewriting systems (SRS). SRSs are well known to
    be Turing complete, allowing for the formal specification of any computable safety
    property. Earlier attempts at Turing complete monitoring have been relatively
    inefficient. This paper demonstrates that monitoring parametric SRSs is practical.
    The presented algorithm uses a modified version of Aho-Corasick string searching
    for quick pattern matching with an incremental rewriting approach that avoids
    reexamining parts of the string known to contain no redexes.'
