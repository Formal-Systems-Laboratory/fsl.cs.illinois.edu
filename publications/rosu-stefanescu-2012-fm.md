  abstract: 'Matching logic reachability has been recently proposed as an alternative
    program verification approach. Unlike Hoare logic, where one defines a language-specific
    proof system that needs to be proved sound for each language separately, matching
    logic reachability provides a *language-independent* and *sound* proof system
    that directly uses the trusted operational semantics of the language as axioms.
    Matching logic reachability thus has a clear practical advantage: it eliminates
    the need for an additional semantics of the same language in order to reason about
    programs, and implicitly eliminates the need for tedious soundness proofs. What
    is not clear, however, is whether matching logic reachability is as powerful as
    Hoare logic. This paper introduces a technique to mechanically translate Hoare
    logic proof derivations into equivalent matching logic reachability proof derivations.
    The presented technique has two consequences: first, it suggests that matching
    logic reachability has no theoretical limitation over Hoare logic; and second,
    it provides a new approach to prove Hoare logics sound.'
