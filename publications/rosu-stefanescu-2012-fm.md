abstract: 'Matching logic reachability has been recently proposed as an alternative
  program verification approach. Unlike Hoare logic, where one defines a language-specific
  proof system that needs to be proved sound for each language separately, matching
  logic reachability provides a *language-independent* and *sound* proof system that
  directly uses the trusted operational semantics of the language as axioms. Matching
  logic reachability thus has a clear practical advantage: it eliminates the need
  for an additional semantics of the same language in order to reason about programs,
  and implicitly eliminates the need for tedious soundness proofs. What is not clear,
  however, is whether matching logic reachability is as powerful as Hoare logic. This
  paper introduces a technique to mechanically translate Hoare logic proof derivations
  into equivalent matching logic reachability proof derivations. The presented technique
  has two consequences: first, it suggests that matching logic reachability has no
  theoretical limitation over Hoare logic; and second, it provides a new approach
  to prove Hoare logics sound.'
