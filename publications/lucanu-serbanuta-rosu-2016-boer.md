  abstract: The K framework was successfully used for defining formal semantics for
    several practical languages, e.g. C, Java, Java Script, but no language with distributed
    concurrent objects was defined in K up to now. In this paper we investigate how
    the model of asynchronous method calls, using the so-called futures for handling
    the return values, can be added to an existing K definition using the ideas from
    the Complete Guide to the Future paper. As the running example we use the K definition
    of Kool, a pedagogical and research language that captures the essence of the
    object-oriented programming paradigm. This is a first step toward a generic methodology
    for modularly adding future-based mechanisms to allow asynchronous method calls.
