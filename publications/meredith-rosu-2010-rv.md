  abstract: 'The RV system is the first system to merge the benefits of Runtime Monitoring
    with Predictive Analysis. The Runtime Monitoring portion of RV is based on the
    successful Monitoring Oriented Programming system developed at the University
    of Illinois [6, 7, 9, 21, 5], while the Predictive Analysis capability is a vastly
    expanded version of the jPredictor System also developed at the University of
    Illinois [11, 14]. With the RV system, runtime monitoring is supported and encouraged
    as a fundamental principle for building reliable software: monitors are automatically
    synthesized from specified properties and integrated into the original system
    to check its dynamic behaviors. When certain conditions of interest occur, such
    as a violation of a specification, user-defined actions will be triggered, which
    can be any code from information logging to runtime recovery. The RV system supports
    the monitoring of parametric properties that may specify a relationship between
    objects. Properties may be defined using one of several logical formalisms, such
    as: extended regular languages, context-free patterns, deterministic finite state
    machines, linear temporal logic, and past time linear temporal logic. The system
    is designed in such a way that adding new logical formalisms is a relatively simple
    task. The predictive capabilities allow any of these monitoring specifications
    to be extended to checking not just the actual runtime traces of program execution,
    but any trace that may be inferred from a constructed casual model. The Predictive
    Analysis also features built in algorithms for race detection and atomicity violations,
    that are both highly useful in concurrent system design and difficult to specify
    in terms of formal specification languages.'
