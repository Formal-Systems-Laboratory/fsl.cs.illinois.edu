  abstract  = {
The Runtime Verification ECU (RV-ECU) is a new development platform for
checking and enforcing the safety of automotive bus communications and
software systems.
RV-ECU uses runtime verification, a formal analysis subfield geared at
validating and verifying systems as they run, to ensure that all
manufacturer and third-party safety specifications are complied with
during the operation of the vehicle.
By compiling formal safety properties into code using a certifying
compiler, the RV-ECU executes only provably correct code that checks for
safety violations as the system runs.
RV-ECU can also recover from violations of these properties, either
by itself in simple cases or together with safe message-sending
libraries implementable on third-party control units on the bus.
RV-ECU can be updated with new specifications after a
vehicle is released, enhancing the safety of vehicles that have already
been sold and deployed.

Currently a prototype, RV-ECU is meant to eventually be deployed
as global and local ECU safety monitors,  ultimately responsible for the
safety of the entire vehicle system.
We describe its overall architecture and implementation, and
demonstrate monitoring of safety specifications on the CAN bus.
We use past automotive recalls as case studies to demonstrate the
potential of updating the RV-ECU as a cost effective and practical
alternative to software recalls, while requiring the development
of rigorous, formal
safety specifications easily sharable across manufacturers, OEMs,
regulatory agencies and even car owners.},
