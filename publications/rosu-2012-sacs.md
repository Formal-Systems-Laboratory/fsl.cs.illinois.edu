  abstract: 'This paper addresses the problem of runtime verification from a foundational
    perspective, answering questions like <em>Is there a consensus among the various
    definitions of a safety property?</em> (Answer: Yes), <em>How many safety properties
    exist?</em> (Answer: As many as real numbers), <em>How difficult is the problem
    of monitoring a safety property?</em> (Answer: Arbitrarily complex), <em>Is there
    any formalism that can express all safety properties?</em> (Answer: No), etc.
    Various definitions of safety properties as sets of execution traces have been
    proposed in the literature, some over finite traces, others over infinite traces,
    yet others over both finite and infinite traces. By employing cardinality arguments
    and a novel notion of <em>persistence</em>, this paper first establishes the existence
    of bijective correspondences between the various notions of safety property. It
    then shows that safety properties can be characterized as <em>always past</em>
    properties. Finally, it proposes a general notion of <em>monitor</em>, which allows
    to show that safety properties correspond precisely to the monitorable properties,
    and then to establish that monitoring a safety property is arbitrarily hard.'
