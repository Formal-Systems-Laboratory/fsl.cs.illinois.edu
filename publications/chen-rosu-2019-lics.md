  abstract: Matching logic is a logic for specifying and reasoning about structure
    by means of patterns and pattern matching. This paper makes two contributions.
    First, it proposes a sound and complete proof system for matching logic in its
    full generality. Previously, sound and complete deduction for matching logic was
    known only for particular theories providing equality and membership. Second,
    it proposes matching mu-logic, an extension of matching logic with a least fixpoint
    mu-binder. It is shown that matching mu-logic captures as special instances many
    important logics in mathematics and computer science, including first-order logic
    with least fixpoints, modal mu-logic as well as dynamic logic and various temporal
    logics such as infinite/finite-trace linear temporal logic and computation tree
    logic, and notably reachability logic, the underlying logic of the K framework
    for programming language semantics and formal analysis. Matching mu-logic therefore
    serves as a unifying foundation for specifying and reasoning about fixpoints and
    induction, programming languages and program specification and verification.
