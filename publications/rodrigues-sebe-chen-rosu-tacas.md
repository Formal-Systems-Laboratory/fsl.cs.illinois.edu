  abstract: We present a sound and complete axiomatization of finite words using matching
    logic. A unique feature of our axiomatization is that it gives a \emph{shallow
    embedding} of regular expressions into matching logic, and a \emph{logical} representation
    of finite automata. The semantics of both expressions and automata are precisely
    captured as matching logic formulae that evaluate to the corresponding language.
    Regular expressions are matching logic formulae \emph{as is}, while the embedding
    of automata is a \emph{structural analog}---computational aspects of automata
    are captured as syntactic features. We demonstrate that our axiomatization is
    sound and complete by showing that runs of Brzozowski's procedure for equivalence
    checking correspond to matching logic proofs. We propose this as a general methodology
    for producing machine-checkable formal proofs, enabled by capturing structural
    analogs of computational artifacts in logic. The proofs produced can be efficiently
    checked by the Metamath Zero verifier. Work presented in this paper contributes
    to the general scheme of achieving verifiable computing via logical methods, where
    computations are reduced to logical reasoning, encoded as machine-checkable proof
    objects, and checked by a trusted proof checker.
