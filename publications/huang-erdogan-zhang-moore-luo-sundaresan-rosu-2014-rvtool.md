abstract: We present ROSRV, a runtime verification framework for robotic applications
  on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS), a widely used open-source framework
  for robot software development. ROSRV aims to address the safety and security issues
  of robots by providing a transparent monitoring infrastructure that intercepts and
  monitors the commands and messages passing through the system. Safety and security
  properties can be defined in a formal specification language, and are ensured by
  automatically generated monitors. ROSRV integrates seamlessly with ROS---no change
  in ROS nor the application code is needed. ROSRV has been applied and evaluated
  on a commercial robot.
