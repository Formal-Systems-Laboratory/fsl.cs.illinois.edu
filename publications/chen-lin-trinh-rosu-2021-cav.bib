  abstract  = {
We pursue the vision of an ideal language framework, where programming 
language designers only need to define the formal syntax and semantics
of their languages, and all language tools are automatically  generated
by the framework. Due to the complexity of such a language framework,
it is a big challenge to  ensure its trustworthiness and to  establish
the correctness of the autogenerated language tools.  In this paper, we
propose an innovative approach based on  proof generation. The key idea
is to generate proof objects as correctness certificates for each
individual task that the language tools conduct, on a case-by-case basis,
and use a trustworthy proof checker to check the proof objects. This way,
we avoid formally verifying the entire framework, which is practically
impossible, and thus can make the language framework both practical and
trustworthy. As a first step, we formalize program execution as mathematical
proofs and generate their complete proof objects. The experimental result
shows that the performance of our proof object generation and proof
checking is very promising.
