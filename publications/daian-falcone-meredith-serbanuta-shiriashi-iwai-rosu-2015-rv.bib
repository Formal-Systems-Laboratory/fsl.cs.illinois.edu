  abstract  = {
RV-Android is a new freely available open source runtime library for
monitoring formal safety properties on Android.
RV-Android uses the commercial RV-Monitor technology as its core monitoring
library generation technology, allowing for the verification of safety
properties during execution and operating entirely in userspace with no
kernel or operating system modifications required.
RV-Android improves on previous Android monitoring work by replacing the
JavaMOP framework with RV-Monitor, a more advanced monitoring library
generation tool with core algorithmic improvements that greatly improve
resource consumption, efficiency, and battery life considerations.
We demonstrate the developer usage of RV-Android with the standard Android
build process, using instrumentation mechanisms effective on both Android
binaries and source code.
Our method allows for both property development and advanced application
testing through runtime verification.
We showcase the user frontend of RV-Monitor, which is available for public
demo use and requires no knowledge of RV concepts.
We explore the extra expressiveness the MOP paradigm provides over simply
writing properties as aspects through two sample security properties, and
show an example of a real security violation mitigated by RV-Android
on-device.
Lastly, we propose RV as an extension to the next-generation Android
permissions system debuting in Android M.},
