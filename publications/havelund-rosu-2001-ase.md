  abstract: We present a rewriting algorithm for efficiently testing future time Linear
    Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae on finite execution traces. The standard models
    of LTL are infinite traces, reflecting the behavior of reactive and concurrent
    systems which conceptually may be continuously alive. In most past applications
    of LTL, theorem provers and model checkers have been used to formally prove that
    down-scaled models satisfy such LTL specifications. Our goal is instead to use
    LTL for up-scaled testing of real software applications, corresponding to analyzing
    the conformance of finite traces against LTL formulae. We first describe what
    it means for a finite trace to satisfy an LTL formula and then suggest an optimized
    algorithm based on transforming LTL formulae. We use the Maude rewriting logic,
    which turns out to be a good notation and being supported by an efficient rewriting
    engine for performing these experiments. The work constitutes part of the Java
    PathExplorer (\JPaXX) project, the purpose of which is to develop a flexible tool
    for monitoring Java program executions.
