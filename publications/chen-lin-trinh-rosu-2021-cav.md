  abstract: We pursue the vision of an ideal language framework, where programming
    language designers only need to define the formal syntax and semantics of their
    languages, and all language tools are automatically generated by the framework.
    Due to the complexity of such a language framework, it is a big challenge to ensure
    its trustworthiness and to establish the correctness of the autogenerated language
    tools. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach based on proof generation.
    The key idea is to generate proof objects as correctness certificates for each
    individual task that the language tools conduct, on a case-by-case basis, and
    use a trustworthy proof checker to check the proof objects. This way, we avoid
    formally verifying the entire framework, which is practically impossible, and
    thus can make the language framework both practical and trustworthy. As a first
    step, we formalize program execution as mathematical proofs and generate their
    complete proof objects. The experimental result shows that the performance of
    our proof object generation and proof checking is very promising.
