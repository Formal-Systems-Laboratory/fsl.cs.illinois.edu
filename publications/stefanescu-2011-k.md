  abstract: This paper presents MatchC, a matching logic reachability verifier using
    the K framework. K is a rewriting-based framework for defining and analyzing programming
    languages. Matching logic is a logic designed to state and reason about structural
    properties over arbitrary program configurations. Matching logic reachability
    is a unifying framework for operational and axiomatic semantics of programing
    languages. The MatchC verifier (http://matching-logic.org/) checks reachability
    properties of programs written in a deterministic fragment of C and is implemented
    in the K framework. This paper discusses the correctness of the implementation
    of the matching logic reachability proof system in MatchC. The main contributions
    of this paper are the implementation of the verifier, with emphasis on using K
    for program verification, and the evaluation of the tool on a large number of
    programs, including complex ones, like programs implementing the AVL trees data
    structure and the Schorr-Waite graph marking algorithm.
