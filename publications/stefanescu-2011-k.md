abstract: This paper presents MatchC, a matching logic reachability verifier using
  the K framework. K is a rewriting-based framework for defining and analyzing programming
  languages. Matching logic is a logic designed to state and reason about structural
  properties over arbitrary program configurations. Matching logic reachability is
  a unifying framework for operational and axiomatic semantics of programing languages.
  The MatchC verifier (http://matching-logic.org/) checks reachability properties
  of programs written in a deterministic fragment of C and is implemented in the K
  framework. This paper discusses the correctness of the implementation of the matching
  logic reachability proof system in MatchC. The main contributions of this paper
  are the implementation of the verifier, with emphasis on using K for program verification,
  and the evaluation of the tool on a large number of programs, including complex
  ones, like programs implementing the AVL trees data structure and the Schorr-Waite
  graph marking algorithm.
