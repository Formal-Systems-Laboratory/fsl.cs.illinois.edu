Monitoring-Oriented Programming (MOP) helps develop more reliable
software by means of monitoring against formal specifications.  
While MOP showed promising results, all prior research has focused on
checking a single version of a target software application.  
We propose to extend MOP to support multiple software versions and
thus be more relevant in the context of rapid software evolution.  
Our approach, called eMOP, is inspired by regression test
selection---a well studied, evolution-centered technique.  
The key idea in eMOP is to monitor only the parts of code that
changed between versions.  
We illustrate eMOP by means of a running example, and show the
results of preliminary experiments.  
eMOP opens up a new line of research on MOP---it can significantly
improve usability and performance when applied across multiple
versions of an application, and is complementary to algorithmic MOP
advances on single versions.
