abstract: This paper introduces behavioral rewrite systems, where rewriting is used
  to evaluate experiments, and behavioral productivity, which says that each experiment
  can be fully evaluated, and investigates some of their properties. First, it is
  shown that, in the case of (infinite) streams, behavioral productivity generalizes
  and may bring to a more basic rewriting setting the existing notion of stream productivity
  defined in the context of infinite rewriting and lazy strategies; some arguments
  are given that in some cases one may prefer the behavioral approach. Second, a behavioral
  productivity criterion is given, which reduces the problem to conventional term
  rewrite system termination, so that one can use off-the-shelf termination tools
  and techniques for checking behavioral productivity in general, not only for streams.
  Finally, behavioral productivity is shown to be equivalent to a proof-theoretic
  (rather than model-theoretic) notion of behavioral well-specifiedness, and its difficulty
  in the arithmetic hierarchy is shown to be <math>\Pi_2^0</math>-complete.
