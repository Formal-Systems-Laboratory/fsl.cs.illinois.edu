  abstract: We study the complexity of deciding the equality of streams specified
    by systems of equations. There are several notions of stream models in the literature,
    each generating a different semantics of stream equality. We pinpoint the complexity
    of each of these notions in the arithmetical or analytical hierarchy. Their complexity
    ranges from low levels of the arithmetical hierarchy such as $\cpi{0}{2}$ for
    the most relaxed stream models, to levels of the analytical hierarchy such as
    $\cpi{1}{1}$ and up to subsuming the entire analytical hierarchy for more restricted
    but natural stream models. Since all these classes properly include both the semi-decidable
    and co-semi-decidable classes, it follows that regardless of the stream semantics
    employed, there is no complete proof system or algorithm for determining equality
    or inequality of streams. We also discuss several related problems, such as the
    existence and uniqueness of stream solutions for systems of equations, as well
    as the equality of such solutions.
