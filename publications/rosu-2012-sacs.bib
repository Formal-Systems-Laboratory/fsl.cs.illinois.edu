  title={On Safety Properties and Their Monitoring},
  abstract = {
This paper addresses the problem of runtime verification from a foundational
perspective, answering questions like
<em>Is there a consensus among the various definitions of a safety property?</em>
(Answer: Yes),
<em>How many safety properties exist?</em>
(Answer: As many as real numbers),
<em>How difficult is the problem of monitoring a safety property?</em>
(Answer: Arbitrarily complex),
<em>Is there any formalism that can express all safety properties?</em>
(Answer: No),
etc.
Various definitions of safety properties as sets of execution traces
have been proposed in the literature, some over finite traces,
others over infinite traces, yet others over both finite and infinite
traces.
By employing cardinality arguments and a novel notion of
<em>persistence</em>, this paper first establishes the existence of bijective
correspondences between the various notions of safety property.
It then shows that safety properties can be characterized as
<em>always past</em> properties.
Finally, it proposes a general notion of <em>monitor</em>, which allows to
show that safety properties correspond precisely to the monitorable
properties, and then to establish that monitoring a safety property
is arbitrarily hard.
