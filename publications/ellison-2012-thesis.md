  abstract: This dissertation shows that complex, real programming languages can be
    completely formalized in the K Framework, yielding interpreters and analysis tools
    for testing and bug detection. This is demonstrated by providing, in K, the first
    complete formal semantics of the C programming language. With varying degrees
    of effort, tools such as interpreters, debuggers, and model-checkers, together
    with tools that check for memory safety, races, deadlocks, and undefined behavior
    are then generated from the semantics. Being executable, the semantics has been
    thoroughly tested against the GCC torture test suite and successfully passes 99.2\%
    of 776 test programs. The semantics is also evaluated against popular analysis
    tools, using a new test suite in addition to a third-party test suite. The semantics-based
    tool performs at least as well or better than the other tools tested.
