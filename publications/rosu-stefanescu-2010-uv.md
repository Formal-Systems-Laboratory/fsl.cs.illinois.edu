  abstract: 'Matching logic is a new program verification logic, which builds upon
    operational semantics. Matching logic specifications are constrained symbolic
    program configurations, called *patterns*, which can be *matched* by concrete
    configurations. By building upon an operational semantics of the language and
    allowing specifications to directly refer to the structure of the configuration,
    matching logic has at least three benefits that could be key factors in its usability:
    (1) One''s familiarity with the formalism reduces to one''s familiarity with the
    operational semantics of the language, that is, with the language itself; (2)
    The verification process proceeds the same way as the execution of the program,
    making debugging failed proof attempts manageable because one can always see the
    ``current configuration'''' and ``what went wrong'''', same like in a debugger;
    and (3) Nothing is lost in translation, that is, there is no gap between the language
    itself and its verifier. Moreover, direct access to the structure of the configuration
    facilitates defining sub-patterns that one may reason about, such as disjoint
    lists or trees in the heap, as well as supporting framing in various components
    of the configuration at no additional costs.'
