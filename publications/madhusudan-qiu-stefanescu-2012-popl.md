  abstract: We develop logical mechanisms and procedures to facilitate the verification
    of full functional properties of inductive tree data-structures using recursion
    that are sound, incomplete, but terminating. Our contribution rests in a new extension
    of first-order logic with recursive definitions called *Dryad*, a syntactical
    restriction on pre- and post-conditions of recursive imperative programs using
    *Dryad*, and a systematic methodology for accurately unfolding the footprint on
    the heap uncovered by the program that leads to finding simple recursive proofs
    using formula abstraction and calls to SMT solvers. We evaluate our methodology
    empirically and show that several complex tree data-structure algorithms can be
    checked against full functional specifications automatically, given pre- and post-conditions.
    This results in the first automatic terminating methodology for proving a wide
    variety of annotated algorithms on tree data-structures correct, including max-heaps,
    treaps, red-black trees, AVL trees, binomial heaps, and B-trees.
