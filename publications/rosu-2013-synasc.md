  abstract: K is a rewrite-based executable semantic framework for defining languages.
    The K framework is designed to allow implementing a variety of generic tools that
    can be used with any language defined in K, such as parsers, interpreters, symbolic
    execution engines, semantic debuggers, test-case generators, state-space explorers,
    model checkers, and even deductive program verifiers. The latter are based on
    matching logic for expressing static properties, and on reachability logic for
    expressing dynamic properties. Several large languages have been already defined
    or are being defined in K, including C, Java, Python, Javascript, and LLVM.
