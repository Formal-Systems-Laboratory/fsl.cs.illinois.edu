  abstract          = {
    K framework is an effort in realizing the ideal language framework where programming languages
must have formal semantics and all languages tools are automatically generated from the formal
semantics in a correct-by-construction manner at no additional costs. In this extended abstract,
we present matching mu-logic as the foundation of K and discuss some of its applications in defining
constructors, transition systems, modal mu-logic and temporal logic variants, and reachability logic.
