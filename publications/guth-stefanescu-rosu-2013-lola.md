  abstract: Matching logic reachability is an emerging verification approach which
    uses a language-independent proof system to prove program properties based on
    the operational semantics. In this paper we apply this approach in the context
    of a low-level real-time language with interrupts, in which each instruction takes
    a specified time to execute. In particular, we verify that if the interrupts are
    scheduled with large enough intervals, the program execution terminates yielding
    the correct result. Surprisingly, it turns out that matching logic reachability
    can handle the low-level and real-time features of the language just by using
    their operational semantics, and that language specific reasoning is unnecessary.
