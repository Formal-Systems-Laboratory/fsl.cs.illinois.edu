  abstract  = {
This paper presents a verification framework that is parametric in a (trusted)
operational semantics of some programming language.
The underlying proof system is language-independent and consists of eight proof
rules.
The proof system is proved partially correct and relatively complete (with
respect to the programming language configuration model).
To show its practicality, the generic framework is instantiated with a fragment
of C and evaluated with encouraging results.
