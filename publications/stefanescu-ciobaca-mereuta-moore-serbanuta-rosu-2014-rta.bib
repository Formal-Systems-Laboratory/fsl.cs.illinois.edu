  abstract  = {
This paper presents a language-independent proof system for reachability
properties of programs written in non-deterministic (e.g. concurrent) languages,
referred to as *all-path reachability logic*.
It derives partial-correctness properties with all-path semantics (a state
satisfying a given precondition reaches states satisfying a given postcondition
on all terminating execution paths).
The proof system takes as axioms any unconditional operational semantics, and is
sound (partially correct) and (relatively) complete, independent of the
object language; the soundness has also been mechanized (Coq).
This approach is implemented in a tool for semantics-based verification as part
of the K framework.
