  abstract: Runtime monitoring is an effective means to improve the reliability of
    systems. In recent years, parametric monitoring, which is highly suitable for
    object-oriented systems, has gained significant traction. Previous work on the
    performance of parametric runtime monitoring has focused on the performance of
    monitoring only one specification at a time. A realistic system, however, has
    numerous properties that need to be monitored simultaneously. This paper introduces
    scalable techniques to improve the performance of one of the fastest parametric
    monitoring systems, JavaMOP, in the presence of multiple simultaneous properties,
    resulting in average runtime overheads that are less than the summation of the
    overheads of the properties run in isolation. An extensive evaluation shows that
    these techniques, which were derived following a thorough investigation and analysis
    of the current bottlenecks in JavaMOP, improve its runtime performance in the
    presence of multiple properties by up to two times and the memory usage by 34\%.
