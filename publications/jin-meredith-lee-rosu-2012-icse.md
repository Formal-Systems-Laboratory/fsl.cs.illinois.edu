  abstract: Runtime monitoring is a technique usable in all phases of the software
    development cycle, from initial testing, to debugging, to actually maintaining
    proper function in production code. Of particular importance are parametric monitoring
    systems, which allow the specification of properties that relate objects in a
    program, rather than only global properties. In the past decade, a number of parametric
    runtime monitoring systems have been developed. Here we give a demonstration of
    our system, JavaMOP. It is the only parametric monitoring system that allows multiple
    differing logical formalisms. It is also the most efficient in terms of runtime
    overhead, and very competitive with respect to memory usage.
