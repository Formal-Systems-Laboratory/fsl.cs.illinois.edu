  abstract: In this paper, we present a formal verification tool for the Ethereum
    Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. To precisely reason about all possible behaviors
    of the EVM bytecode, we adopted KEVM, a complete formal semantics of the EVM,
    and instantiated the K-framework's reachability logic theorem prover to generate
    a correct-by-construction deductive verifier for the EVM. We further optimized
    the verifier by introducing EVM-specific abstractions and lemmas to improve its
    scalability. Our EVM verifier has been used to verify various high-profile smart
    contracts including the ERC20 token, Ethereum Casper, and DappHub MakerDAO contracts.
