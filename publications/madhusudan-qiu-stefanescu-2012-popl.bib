  abstract  = {
We develop logical mechanisms and procedures to facilitate the verification of
full functional properties of inductive tree data-structures using recursion
that are sound, incomplete, but terminating.
Our contribution rests in a new extension of first-order logic with recursive
definitions called *Dryad*, a syntactical restriction on pre- and
post-conditions of recursive imperative programs using *Dryad*, and a systematic
methodology for accurately unfolding the footprint on the heap uncovered by the
program that leads to finding simple recursive proofs using formula abstraction
and calls to SMT solvers.
We evaluate our methodology empirically and show that several complex tree
data-structure algorithms can be checked against full functional specifications
automatically, given pre- and post-conditions.
This results in the first automatic terminating methodology for proving a wide
variety of annotated algorithms on tree data-structures correct, including
max-heaps, treaps, red-black trees, AVL trees, binomial heaps, and B-trees.
