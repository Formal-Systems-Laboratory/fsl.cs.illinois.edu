  abstract: Runtime verification can effectively increase the reliability of software
    systems. In recent years, parametric runtime verification has gained a lot of
    traction, with several systems proposed. However, lack of real specifications
    and prohibitive runtime overhead when checking numerous properties simultaneously
    prevent developers or users from using runtime verification. This paper reports
    on more than 150 formal specifications manually derived from the Java API documentation
    of commonly used packages, as well as a series of novel techniques which resulted
    in a new runtime verification system, RV-Monitor. Experiments show that these
    specifications are useful for finding bugs and bad software practice, and RV-Monitor
    is capable of monitoring all our specifications simultaneously, and runs substantially
    faster than other state-of-the-art runtime verification systems.
