  abstract  = {
This paper proposes the use of formal semantics as a basis for
worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis.
Specifically, the semantics of a RISC assembly language is
formally defined using recent advances in rewrite-based semantics,
and then is used to discover and eliminate erroneous execution
paths in the context of WCET analysis.
This paper makes two novel contributions:
(1) it shows that using a formal semantics of the employed language
can be practically feasible in WCET analysis (not only theoretically
desirable); and
(2) it shows that the discovery and elimination of erroneous execution
paths can not only improve the WCET estimation, but can also be achieved
using off-the-shelf technology for rewrite-based semantics.
