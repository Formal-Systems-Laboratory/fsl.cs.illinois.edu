  abstract  = {
We introduce term-generic logic (TGL), a first-order logic
parameterized with terms defined axiomatically (rather than
constructively), by requiring terms to only provide 
free variable and substitution operators satisfying some reasonable axioms.
TGL has a notion of model that generalizes both first-order models 
and Henkin models of the lambda-calculus.  The abstract notions of term syntax and model 
are shown to be sufficient for obtaining  
the completeness theorem of a Gentzen system generalizing that of first-order logic.  
Various systems featuring bindings and contextual reasoning, 
ranging from pure type systems to the pi-calculus, 
are captured as theories inside TGL.
For two particular, but rather typical instances---untyped lambda-calculus and
System F---the general-purpose TGL models are shown to be equivalent with
standard ad hoc models.
