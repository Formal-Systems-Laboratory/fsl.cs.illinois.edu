We present a suite of runtime verification tools developed by Runtime
Verification Inc.: RV-Match, RV-Predict, and RV-Monitor.
RV-Match is a tool for checking C programs for undefined behavior and other
common programmer mistakes.
It is extracted from the most complete formal
semantics of the C11 language and beats many similar tools in its ability to
catch a broad range of undesirable behaviors.
RV-Predict is a dynamic data race detector for Java and C/C++ programs.
It is perhaps the only tool that is both sound and maximal: it only reports
real races and it can find all races that can be found by any other sound
data race detector analyzing the same execution trace.
RV-Monitor is a runtime monitoring tool that checks and enforces safety and
security properties during program execution.
Our tools focus on reporting no false positives and are free for non-commercial
use.},
