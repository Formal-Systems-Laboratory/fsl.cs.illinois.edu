  title     = {Language Definitions as Rewrite Theories},
  abstract  = {
K is a formal framework for defining operational semantics of programming
languages.
The K-Maude compiler translates \K language definitions to Maude rewrite
theories.
The compiler enables program execution by using the Maude rewrite engine with
the compiled definitions, and program analysis by using various Maude analysis
tools.
K supports symbolic execution in Maude by means of an automatic transformation
of language definitions.
The transformed definition is called the *\em symbolic extension* of the
original definition.
In this paper we investigate the theoretical relationship between K language
definitions and their Maude translations, between symbolic extensions of K
definitions and their Maude translations, and how the relationship between K
definitions and their symbolic extensions is reflected on their respective
representations in Maude.
In particular, the results show how analysis performed with Maude tools can be
formally lifted up to the original language definitions.
