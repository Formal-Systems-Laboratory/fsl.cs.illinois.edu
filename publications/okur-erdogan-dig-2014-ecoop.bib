  abstract  = {
Parallel libraries continuously evolve from low-level to higher-level 
abstractions. However, developers are not up-to-date with these
higher-level abstractions, thus their parallel code might be hard to read,
slow, and unscalable. Using a corpus of 880 open-source C# applications,
we found that developers still use the old Thread and ThreadPool
abstractions in 62% of the cases when they use parallel abstractions.
Converting code to higher-level abstractions is (i) tedious and (ii) error-prone.
e.g., it can harm performance and silence the uncaught exceptions.
We present two automated migration tools, Taskifier and Simplifier
that work for C# code. The first tool transforms old style Thread and
ThreadPool abstractions to Task abstractions. The second tool transforms
code with Task abstractions into higher-level design patterns. Using
our code corpus, we have applied these tools 3026 and 405 times,
respectively. Our empirical evaluation shows that the tools (i) are highly
applicable, (ii) reduce the code bloat, (iii) are much safer than manual
transformations. We submitted 66 patches generated by our tools, and
the open-source developers accepted 53.
