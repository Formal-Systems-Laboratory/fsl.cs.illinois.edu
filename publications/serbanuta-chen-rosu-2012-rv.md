  abstract: 'This paper shows that it is possible to build a maximal and sound causal
    model for concurrent computations from a given execution trace. It is sound, in
    the sense that any program which can generate a trace can also generate all traces
    in its causal model. It is maximal (among sound models), in the sense that by
    extending the causal model of an observed trace with a new trace, the model becomes
    unsound: there exists a program generating the original trace which cannot generate
    the newly introduced trace. Thus, the maximal sound model has the property that
    it comprises all traces which all programs that can generate the original trace
    can also generate. The existence of such a model is of great theoretical value
    as it can be used to prove the soundness of non-maximal, and thus smaller, causal
    models.'
