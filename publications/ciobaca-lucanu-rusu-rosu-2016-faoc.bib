  abstract  = {
  Two programs are fully equivalent if, for the same input, either
  they both diverge or they both terminate with the same
  result. Full equivalence is an adequate notion of equivalence for
  programs written in deterministic languages.  It is useful in many
  contexts, such as capturing the correctness of program
  transformations within the same language, or capturing the
  correctness of compilers between two different languages. 

  In this paper we introduce a language-independent proof system for
  full equivalence, which is parametric in the operational semantics
  of two languages and in a state-similarity relation. The proof
  system is sound: a proof tree establishes the full equivalence of
  the programs given to it as input. We illustrate it on two programs
  in two different languages (an imperative one and a functional one),
  that both compute the Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence is an
  interesting case study since it is not known weather the sequence
  terminates or not; nevertheless, our proof system shows that the two
  programs are fully equivalent (even if we cannot establish
  termination or divergence of either one).
