  abstract  = {
We present a logical framework in which abstract interpretations can be
naturally specified and then verified.  Our approach is based on
membership equational logic which extends equational logics by membership
axioms, asserting that a term has a certain sort.  We represent an
abstract interpretation as a membership equational logic
specification, usually as an overloaded order-sorted signature 
with membership axioms.  It turns out that, for any term, its least
sort over this specification corresponds to its most concrete abstract
value.  Maude implements membership equational logic and provides
mechanisms to calculate the least sort of a term efficiently.  We first
show how Maude can be used to get prototyping of abstract interpretations
for free.  Building on the meta-logic facilities of Maude, we further
develop a tool that automatically checks an abstract interpretation
against a set of user-defined properties.  This can be used to select an
appropriate abstract interpretation, to characterize the specific loss of
information during abstraction, and to compare different abstractions with
each other.
