# CS521 - Foundations of Crypto: From Blockchain to Present (Spring 2026)

Students enrolled in this class are expected to check this web page regularly. 
Complete lecture notes will be posted here.

## Zoom Link

This class will be taught on Wednesdays on the main UIUC campus, and on Fridays at the UIUC center in Chicago.  Students are welcome to attend both in person if they can/want, but they can also attend the class online at the following Zoom link:

## Course Description

This class will introduce the fundamental concepts that underlie the emerging Crypto and Web3 technology in general, mostly but incorrectly identified with "blockchains".  Starting with basic concepts such as how to calculate hashes, sign transactions, and authenticate signatures, the course will then dive into consensus protocols, verifiable computing and zero-knowledge cryptography, blockchain languages and virtual machines, as well we various incentivization mechanisms for actors in decentralized networks to operate honestly.  The students taking this class will also be asked to read papers and blogs and discuss these topics in class, including potentially controversial topics which are of interest to the growing blockchain community.

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic understanding of math, to understand how and why a distributed protocol works, how a hash function is computed, and how a program is executed and produces a proof of its execution.

- Meetings: W/F 15:30-16:45.  On Wednesday, class will be taught on the Urbana-Champaign campus, in room Siebel 0220.  On Fridays, it will be taught at the UIUC Chicago center (Room 1XILLC-ARR).
