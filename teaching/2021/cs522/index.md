## Course Description {#course_description}

CS522 is an advanced course on semantics of programming languages.
Various semantic approaches and related aspects will be defined and
investigated. Executable semantics of various programming languages and
paradigms will be discussed, together with major theoretical models.

-   *Meetings*: Tu/Th 12:30 - 13:45, Zoom: see link above.
-   *Professor*: Grigore Rosu (Office: SC 2110, WWW: <http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/grosu>, Email: grosu@illinois.edu)
-   *Office hours*: By appointment, very flexible (held by Grigore Rosu either in SC 2110 or on Zoom at the same link as above)

The links below provide you with useful material for this class,
including complete lecture notes. These materials will be added *by
need* and more topics will be added.

-   [Introduction](01-Introduction.pdf)

-   Conventional Semantic Approaches

    -   [Book material on IMP, Big-Step SOS, Small-Step SOS, and Denotational
        Semantics](CS522-Fall-2021-basic-semantics.pdf)

-   Rewriting Logic and Maude

    -   [slides](CS522-Fall-2021-Maude.pdf) - recommended only for a quick look
    -   [Book material](CS522-Fall-2021-Maude-book.pdf) - recommended

-   ### HW1 (due Thursday, September 16) {#hw1}

    The following exercises are from the book material above. Do them only in
    Maude (that is, *not* on paper) by modifying [the provided Maude code for
    HW1](CS522-Fall-2021-Maude-HW1.zip): Exercise 56 (page 137); Exercise 70
    (page 155).

    In case you are not familiar with Maude, you are encouraged to do the
    following exercises to warm-up (but please do not include them as part of
    your HW1 submission): Exercise 30; Exercise 32; Exercise 33; Exercise 35;
    Exercise 36. All at pages 80/81.

-   ### HW2 (due Thursday, September 30; allowed until Tuesday, October 5, but this is an easy HW, so earlier submission possible and appreciated)

    The following exercises related to denotational semantics are from the book
    material above: Exercises 80, 81, 82 (page 168; write these up on paper, or
    in a PDF); Exercise 83 (page 169; do it only in Maude, that is, *not* on
    paper, by modifying [the provided Maude code for
    HW2](CS522-Fall-2021-Maude-HW2.zip)).

-   [Book material on IMP++: Challenging Big-Step SOS, Small-Step SOS, and
    Denotational Semantics](CS522-Fall-2021-IMP++.pdf)

-   ### HW3 (due Thursday, October 14)

    Combine all the individual extensions of IMP in [the provided Maude code for
    HW3 (similar to that provided for HW2)](CS522-Fall-2021-Maude-HW3.zip) into the IMP++ language. Read the book
    material above for all the technical details. You should create a subfolder
    of imp called 6-imp++, and that should have four subfolders, one for each
    semantic style. Provide also three IMP++ programs.
