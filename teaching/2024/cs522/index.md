## Course Description {#course_description}

CS522 is an advanced course on semantics of programming languages.
Various semantic approaches and related aspects will be defined and
investigated. Executable semantics of various programming languages and
paradigms will be discussed, together with major theoretical models.

-   ### HW1 (due Thursday, February 1st, AoE) {#hw1}

    The following exercises are from the book material above. Do them only in
    Maude (that is, *not* on paper) by modifying [the provided Maude code for
    HW1](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-HW1.zip): Exercise 56 (page 137); Exercise 70
    (page 155).

    In case you are not familiar with Maude, you are encouraged to do the
    following exercises to warm-up (but please do not include them as part of
    your HW1 submission): Exercise 30; Exercise 32; Exercise 33; Exercise 35;
    Exercise 36. All at pages 80/81.

-   ### HW2 (due Thursday, February 15, AoE) {#hw2}

    The following exercises related to denotational semantics are from the book
    material above: Exercises 80, 81, 82 (page 168; write these up on paper, or
    in a PDF); Exercise 83 (page 169; do it only in Maude, that is, *not* on
    paper, by modifying [the provided Maude code for
    HW2](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-HW2.zip)).
