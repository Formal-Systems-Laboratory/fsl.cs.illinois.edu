## Course Description {#course_description}

CS522 is an advanced course on semantics of programming languages.
Various semantic approaches and related aspects will be defined and
investigated. Executable semantics of various programming languages and
paradigms will be discussed, together with major theoretical models.

-   *Meetings*: Tu/Th 11:00 - 12:15

        Semantics](CS522-Spring-2024-basic-semantics.pdf)

-   Rewriting Logic and Maude

    -   [slides](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude.pdf) - recommended only for a quick look
    -   [Book material](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-book.pdf) - recommended
 
-   ### HW1 (due Thursday, February 1st, AoE) {#hw1}

    The following exercises are from the book material above. Do them only in
    Maude (that is, *not* on paper) by modifying [the provided Maude code for
    HW1](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-HW1.zip): Exercise 56 (page 137); Exercise 70
    (page 155).

    In case you are not familiar with Maude, you are encouraged to do the
    following exercises to warm-up (but please do not include them as part of
    your HW1 submission): Exercise 30; Exercise 32; Exercise 33; Exercise 35;
    Exercise 36. All at pages 80/81.

-   ### HW2 (due Thursday, February 15, AoE) {#hw2}

    The following exercises related to denotational semantics are from the book
    material above: Exercises 80, 81, 82 (page 168; write these up on paper, or
    in a PDF); Exercise 83 (page 169; do it only in Maude, that is, *not* on
    paper, by modifying [the provided Maude code for
    HW2](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-HW2.zip)).

-   [Book material on IMP++: Challenging Big-Step SOS, Small-Step SOS, and
    Denotational Semantics](CS522-Spring-2024-IMP++.pdf)

-   ### HW3 (due Tuesday, March 5)

    Combine all the individual extensions of IMP in [the provided Maude code for
    HW3 (similar to that provided for HW2)](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-HW3.zip) into the IMP++ language. Read the book
    material above for all the technical details. You should create a subfolder
    of imp called 6-imp++, and that should have four subfolders, one for each
    semantic style. Provide also three IMP++ programs.  Note: Big-step and Denotational will be the most tedious, because they are the least modular.  Pick only one of them, and do the other for fun and extra-credit (if you want it).

-  [Book material on Modular SOS, Evaluation Contexts, and the CHAM](CS522-Spring-2024-MSOS-RSEC-CHAM.pdf)

-   ### HW4 (due Tuesday, March 12)

    Same as HW3 but for the three additional semantic approaches discussed in the
    lecture notes above: MSOS, RSEC, and CHAM. Use
    [this provided Maude code for HW4](CS522-Spring-2024-Maude-HW4.zip).
    Handle also a short essay discussing the advantages and limitations of each of
    the semantic approaches discussed so far in class, assigning a (justified) score
    between 1 and 10 to each of them.

-   Category theory: definition, diagrams, cones and limits, exponentials
