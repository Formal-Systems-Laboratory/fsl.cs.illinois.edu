# CS422 - Programming Language Design (Fall 2024)

Students enrolled in this class are expected to check this web page regularly. 
Complete lecture notes will be posted here, following the same model as in [CS422 in Fall 2023](https://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/2023/cs422/).

## Zoom Link

We may sometimes meet online on zoom, eg when traveling to professional events:

### Lecture Recordings

When we meet online, we will record the lectures and post the links here:

[Sept 3](https://illinois.zoom.us/rec/share/PbuJGlCTYhvCxTuDijRvFkaveC6eMExM7wMHEIyhtXTALqq3n9AZX8IIjqqsav9q.LawSiNxgJ5QhicQa)

## Course Description

CS422 is an advanced course on principles of programming language design. Major semantic approaches to programming languages will be discussed, such as structural operational semantics (various kinds), denotational semantics, and rewriting-based semantics. Programming language paradigms will be investigated and rigorously defined, including: imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic programming languages; parameter binding and evaluation strategies; type checking and type inference; concurrency. Since the definitional framework used in this class will be executable, interpreters for the designed languages will be obtained for free. Software analysis tools reasoning about programs in these languages will also arise naturally. Major theoretical models will be discussed.
