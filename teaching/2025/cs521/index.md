## Course Description

This class will introduce the fundamental concepts that underlie the emerging blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.  Starting with basic concepts such as how to calculate hashes, sign transactions, and authenticate signatures, the course will then dive into consensus protocols, verifiable computing and zero-knowledge cryptography, blockchain languages and virtual machines, as well we various incentivization mechanisms for actors in decentralized networks to operate honestly.  The students taking this class will also be asked to read papers and blogs and discuss these topics in class, including potentially controversial topics which are of interest to the growing blockchain community.

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic understanding of math, to understand how and why a distributed protocol works, how a hash function is computed, and how a program is executed and produces a proof of its execution.

- Meetings: W/F 15:30-16:45.  On Wednesday, class will be taught on the Urbana-Champaign campus, in room Siebel 0220.  On Fridays, it will be taught at the UIUC Chicago center (Room ARR ?).
